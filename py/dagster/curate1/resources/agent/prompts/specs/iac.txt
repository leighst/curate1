# IaC
I am interested in IaC or infrastructure as code, infrastructure deployment, infrastructure definition tools etc., plus tools and techniques directly related to these tools.

I want you to be on the lookout for highly relevant info about popular tools like
* terraform
* pulumi
* cloud formation
* google's cloud deployment manager
* crossplane
* etc.

You should also keep an eye out for tools that are in the ecosystem of these tools, such as
* terragrunt
* env0
* terraspace
* spacelift
* terrakube
* etc.

I want you to be on the lookout for highly relevant info about cutting edge tools like 
* system initiative
* winglang
* etc.

Regarding kubernetes:
* Although you may be tempted to include information about kubernetes, I view kube as being a different sort of tool, UNLESS it is being used for deploying infrastructure.
* For example, any discussion of kube for the usual task of defining services is not very interesting to me.
* On the other hand, products like anthos configuration manager or crossplane are interesting to me because they are tools for managing infrastructure.

General guidance:
* I am not interested in posts that are just simple howtos or tutorials. If the post could have been derived just by reading the docs, its probably not relevant. I am looking for novel insights.
* News IS interesting to me. New feature announcements, new product announcements in this area etc are probably very relevant to me. 
* Include tools, products, services, and analysis that are closely related to this area. For example, there is a product called terrascan that provides policy checking for terraform - we should consider including a post about terrascan because it is in the ecosystem of terraform. 
* A relevant post must be ABOUT this domain. You should not simply include a post because it mentions a tool or product that is in the ecosystem of this area. Something in this domain should be the primary topic of the post.
