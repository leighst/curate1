# Coding with AI
I am interested in new developments in the area of coding with AI. This includes tools and techniques for writing code, as well as new products and services that use AI to improve coding.

I am especially interested in blog posts, papers, or other writing that documents how a developer has used AI to write code. 
For example, the following posts would be considered highly relevant:
* A post from Simon Willison about how he used chatgpt to rapidly develop a device driver despite not knowing the language beforehand. 
* A post from a developer about uploading an entire codebase to an Claude Opus and then asking questions about the codebase. 
* A post from a developer about using AI to write code in a language they don't know yet. 
* A post from a non-engineer about creating an entire project from scratch, despite not knowing how to code.
* etc.

I am mostly interested in tools, products, and techniques that use large language models like gpt4, anthropic, or llama3 to write code. 
However, please also be on the lookout for new technologies that are just as or more powerful - I wanto to learn about groundbreaking new techniques as fast as possible! 

You should also keep an eye out for tools that are in the ecosystem of these tools, such as
* terragrunt
* env0
* terraspace
* spacelift
* terrakube
* etc.

I want you to be on the lookout for highly relevant info about cutting edge tools like 
* system initiative
* winglang
* etc.

Regarding kubernetes:
* Although you may be tempted to include information about kubernetes, I view kube as being a different sort of tool, UNLESS it is being used for deploying infrastructure.
* For example, any discussion of kube for the usual task of defining services is not very interesting to me.
* On the other hand, products like anthos configuration manager or crossplane are interesting to me because they are tools for managing infrastructure.

General guidance:
* I am not interested in posts that are just simple howtos or tutorials. If the post could have been derived just by reading the docs, its probably not relevant. I am looking for novel insights.
* News IS interesting to me. New feature announcements, new product announcements in this area etc are probably very relevant to me. 
* Include tools, products, services, and analysis that are closely related to this area. For example, there is a product called terrascan that provides policy checking for terraform - we should consider including a post about terrascan because it is in the ecosystem of terraform. 
* A relevant post must be ABOUT this domain. You should not simply include a post because it mentions a tool or product that is in the ecosystem of this area. Something in this domain should be the primary topic of the post.
