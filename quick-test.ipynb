You get a feel for what's \\\"normal\\\" and for what's unusual, and there are quite a few degrees of the latter. Take compounds of bromine, for example. Most any working chemist will immediately recognize bromine (there are exceptions) because we don't commonly encounter too many opaque red liquids with a fog of corrosive orange fumes above them in the container. Which is good. That's bromine in oxidation state zero, elemental, and then you have bromide (oxidation state -1), one of the most common anions around. \\\"Chlorides are rabble\\\", said Primo Levi in one of my favorite lines from The Periodic Table, and he was right about that, but bromides are not of much higher social standing. Every cation has a bromide salt, and it's usually one of the cheaper ones in the catalog.So far, so good. But bromine can also go up to +3 and +5 oxidation states, and there things start to get interesting. You can have various mixed-halogen things, all of which are reactive and toxic and are distinguished by their various degrees of vileness. And you can get all sorts of bromine-oxygen species, ranging from the pretty well-known ones like bromate ion (BrO3-) all the way up to. . .well, to the stuff described in this new paper., from Konrad Seppelt at the Freie Universit\\u00e4t Berlin. It contains a whole list of new compounds that send my chemical intuition completely off the rails.I have no \\\"feel\\\" for them whatsoever except a strong desire never to prepare any of them. Prepare any of them? I don't even want to make the starting material. You know you're in for a bumpy ride when your work needs something like bromine fluorine dioxide (bromyl fluoride, BrO2F); no one can claim that they weren't warned. There hasn't even been a reliable synthesis of that stuff until now - Seppelt describes a new one, from the aforementioned sodium bromate, which is fine, and bromine pentafluoride, which is not fine, because it's a hideous oxidizing and fluorinating agent fit to fluorinate you right into the afterlife and whose attempted use in liquid rocket propellent mixtures was abandoned because it was too foul to work with, and, oh yeah, redistilled pure hydrogen fluoride, which is also about as far from \\\"fine\\\" as you can get. The SI of the paper casually mentions that you can use double vacuum distillation in a metal line to get your HF sufficiently anhydrous for the reaction, and you can go ahead and get cranking on that without waiting for me to show up.You condense the latter two reagents onto a solid charge of the bromate at liquid nitrogen temperatures, and then let it warm all the way up to -78C, at which point a \\\"vigorous\\\" reaction sets in. Imagine running these things for the first time, waiting for said reaction and wondering if it's going to stay inside your apparatus or invigorate itself all over the ceiling. Once you have made your bromyl fluoride, you raise the temperature a bit more to -40 and pump off the excess HF and pentafluoride, and you will want an extremely capable trap on the other end of that process, which according to the paper can take several hours, and probably had better. Finally, you sublime off the product from the solid residue in the tropical warmth of -10 or so and seal off that part of the tube.You have now prepared the colorless solid bromine fluorine dioxide. What to do with it? Well, what you don't do is let it warm up too far past +10C, because it's almost certainly going to explode. Keep that phrase in mind, it's going to come in handy in this sort of work. Prof. Seppelt, as the first person with a reliable supply of the pure stuff, set forth to react it with a whole list of things and has produced a whole string of weird compounds with brow-furrowing crystal structures. I don't even know what to call these beasts: how, for example, do you refer to the cation in Br3O6+ triflate? What's the name for the compound shown at right? Very few of us will have the need to name it, though - you make that one by condensing trifluoroacetic anhydride onto the bromyl fluoride at -196C, then warming and recrystallizing the solid from liquified freon to give yellow crystals. Those melt at -12C, and according to the paper and its SI, \\\"The molten red liquid starts to gas slowly\\\" and \\\"inevitably explodes upon further warming\\\". Further experimentation runs a risk of exposure to further inevitabilities, and I'm glad that Prof. Seppelt's expertise in the lab got him through all this.The SI strongly warns readers that the preparations therein must not under any circumstances be scaled up, and that is clearly the advice of someone who has has your best interests at heart. Even at the amounts described, you will want an excellent and well-maintained vacuum line, access to noncommon nonhousehold reagents like the aforementioned bromine pentafluoride, a willingness to do things like redistill anhydrous HF, and you will at all times want to be suited up like you're going to going to spay a velociraptor. Ah, the halogen chemist's life for me, me hearties, yo-ho-ho and a barrel of. . .well, we still don't know what to name it.

In other words, let\\u2019s say the L1 cache is 32K, the L2 cache is 256K, and the L3 cache is 2M, why not have a single 32K + 256K + 2M L1 cache?\\nThe short version is that the various cache levels have very large variations in how they are designed; they are subject to different constraints and fulfill different purposes. As a rule of thumb, as you climb up the levels of the cache hierarchy, the caches get larger, slower, higher density (more bits stored per unit area), consume less power per bit stored, and gain additional tasks.\\nIn the hopes of building some intuition here, let\\u2019s start with an elaborate and somewhat quaint analogy. That\\u2019s right, it is\\u2026\\nCache story time!\\nSuppose you\\u2019re a white-collar office worker in some unnamed sprawling 1960s bureaucracy, with no computers in sight, and your job involves a lot of looking at and cross-referencing case files (here being folders containing sheets of paper).\\nYou have a desk (the L1 data cache). On your desk are the files (cache lines) you\\u2019re working on right now, and some other files you recently pulled and are either done with or expect to be looking at again. Working with a file generally means looking at the individual pages it contains (corresponding to bytes in a cache line). But unless they\\u2019re on your desk, files are just treated as a unit. You always grab whole files at a time, even if there\\u2019s only one page in them that you actually care about right now.\\nAlso in the office is a filing cabinet (L2 cache). That cabinet contains files you\\u2019ve handled recently, but aren\\u2019t using right now. When you\\u2019re done with what\\u2019s on your desk, most of these files will go back into that filing cabinet. Grabbing something from the cabinet isn\\u2019t immediate \\u2013 you need to walk up there, open the right drawer and thumb through a few index cards to find the right file \\u2013 but it\\u2019s still pretty quick.\\nSometimes other people need to look at a file that\\u2019s in your cabinet. There\\u2019s a guy with a cart, Buster (representing a sort of ring bus) who just keeps doing his rounds through all the offices. When an office worker needs a file they don\\u2019t have in their private cabinet, they just write a small request slip and hand it to Buster. For simplicity\\u2019s sake, let\\u2019s just say Buster knows where everything is. So the next time he comes by your office, Buster will check if someone requested any files that are in your cabinet, and if so will just silently pull these files out of the cabinet and put them on his cart. The next time he comes by the office of whoever requested the file, he\\u2019ll drop the file in their cabinet, and leave a receipt on the desk.\\nEvery once in a while, Buster notices a requested file isn\\u2019t in the cabinet, but on the desk instead. In that case, he can\\u2019t just silently grab it; he needs to ask the worker at the desk whether they\\u2019re done with it, and if no, that worker and the one who put in the request need to agree on what to do. There are tediously elaborate corporate protocols on what to do in that situation (meetings will be called for sure!).\\nThe filing cabinets are usually full. That means Buster can\\u2019t just put a new file in; he has to make space first, which he does by grabbing another file, preferably one that hasn\\u2019t been used in a while. Those files, Buster takes to the archive in the basement (L3 cache). In the basement, groups of files are kept densely packed in cardboard boxes on industrial shelving units. The regular office workers don\\u2019t get to come down here at all; it\\u2019s well out of their way and they\\u2019re not familiar with the details of the filing system. We leave that to the archival clerks.\\nWhenever Buster gets down here, he drops all the old files he grabbed for archival in the \\u201cin\\u201d tray at the front desk. He also drops off all the request slips for files that aren\\u2019t in any of the filing cabinets upstairs, but he doesn\\u2019t wait around until the clerks bring the files back, since it takes a while. They\\u2019re just going to take the request slips, pick up the file in question, and drop it off in the \\u201cout\\u201d tray whenever they\\u2019re done. So every time Buster comes around, he grabs whatever is in the \\u201cout\\u201d tray, puts it on his cart and takes it to the recipient when he next comes by.\\nNow, the problem is, there\\u2019s a lot of these files, and even with the efficient packing, they\\u2019re not even close to fitting in the basement. Most of the files are kept off-site; this is an office building in a nice part of town, and rents over here are way too high to spend that much space on storage. Instead, the company rents warehouse space 30 minutes out of town, where most of the old files are kept (this corresponds to DRAM). At the front desk of the basement sits Megan, the Head Archivist. Megan keeps track of which files are kept in the basement, and which are warehoused. So when Buster drops his request slips in the \\u201cin\\u201d tray, she checks which of them correspond to files in the basement (to be handled by the archival clerks) and which aren\\u2019t on-site. The latter just get added to a big pile of requests. Maybe once or twice a day, they send a van to the warehouse to grab the requested files, along with a corresponding number of old files to be mothballed (as said, the basement is full; they need to make space before they can store any more files from the warehouse).\\nBuster doesn\\u2019t know or care about the details of the whole warehousing operation; that\\u2019s Megan\\u2019s job. All he knows is that usually, those request slips he hands to the archive are handled pretty quickly, but sometimes they take hours.\\nBack to the original question\\nSo, what\\u2019s the point of this whole elaborate exercise? Briefly, to establish a more concrete model than an opaque \\u201cmagic cache\\u201d that allows us to think more clearly about the logistics involved. The logistics are just as important in designing a chip as they are in running an efficient office.\\nThe original question was \\u201cwhy don\\u2019t we build a single large cache, instead of several small ones\\u201d. So if you have say a quad-core machine with 4 cores that each have 32KB L1 data cache, 256KB L2 cache, plus 2MB of shared L3 cache, why don\\u2019t we just have a ~3MB shared cache to begin with?\\nIn our analogy: for pretty much the same reason we have individual office desks that are maybe 1.50m wide, instead of seating four different people at a single enormous desk that is 150m wide.\\nThe point of having something on the desk is that it\\u2019s within easy reach. If we make the desk too big, we defeat that purpose: if we need to walk 50m to get the file we want, the fact that it\\u2019s technically \\u201cright here on our desk\\u201d isn\\u2019t really helping. The same goes for L1 caches! Making them bigger makes them (physically) larger. Among other things, this makes accessing them slower and consume more energy (for various reasons). L1 caches are sized so they\\u2019re large enough to be useful, but small enough so they\\u2019re still fast to access.\\nA second point is that L1 caches deal with different types of accesses than other levels in the cache hierarchy. First off, there\\u2019s several of them: there\\u2019s the L1 data cache, but there\\u2019s also a L1 instruction cache, and e.g. Intel Core CPUs also have another instruction cache, the uOp cache, which is (depending on your point of view) either a parallel L1 instruction cache or a \\u201cL0 instruction cache\\u201d. \\nL1 data caches gets asked to read and write individual items that are most commonly between 1 and 8 bytes in size, somewhat more rarely larger (for SIMD instructions). Cache levels higher up in the hierarchy don\\u2019t generally bother with individual bytes. In our office analogy, everything that\\u2019s not on a desk somewhere is just handled at the granularity of individual files (or larger), corresponding to cache lines. The same is true in memory subsystems. When a core is performing a memory access, you deal in individual bytes; the higher-level caches generally handle data wholesale, one cache line at a time.\\nL1 instruction caches have quite different access patterns than data caches do, and unlike the L1 data cache, they\\u2019re read-only as far as the core is concerned. (Writing into the instruction cache generally happens indirectly, by putting the data in one of the higher-level unified caches, and then having the instruction cache reload their data from there). For these (and other) reasons, instruction caches are generally built quite differently from data caches; using a single unified L1 cache means that the resulting design needs to meet several conflicting design criteria, forcing compromises that make it worse at either purpose. A unified L1 cache also needs to handle both the instruction and data traffic, which is quite the load!\\nAs an aside: as a programmer, it\\u2019s easy to ignore how much cache bandwidth is needed to fetch instructions, but it\\u2019s quite a lot. For example, when not running code from the uOp cache, all Intel Core i7 CPU cores can fetch 16 bytes worth of instructions from the L1 instruction cache, every cycle, and will in fact keep doing so as long as instruction execution is keeping up with decoding. At 3GHz, we\\u2019re talking on the order of 50GB/s per core here, just for instruction fetches \\u2013 though, granted, only if the instruction fetch unit is busy all the time, instead of being stalled for some reason or other. In practice, the L2 cache usually only sees a small fraction of this, because L1 instruction caches work quite well. But if you\\u2019re designing a unified L1 cache, you need to anticipate at least bursts of both high instruction and high data traffic (think something like a fast memcpy of a few kilobytes of data with both source and destination in the L1 data caches).\\nThis is a general point, by the way. CPU cores can handle many memory accesses per cycle, as long as they all hit within the L1 caches. For a \\u201cHaswell\\u201d or later Core i7 at 3GHz, we\\u2019re talking aggregate code+data L1 bandwidths well over 300GB/s per core if you have just the right instruction mix; very unlikely in practice, but you still get bursts of very hot activity sometimes.\\nL1 caches are designed to be as fast as possible to handle these bursts of activity when they occur. Only what misses L1 needs to be passed on to higher cache levels, which don\\u2019t need to be nearly as fast, nor have as much bandwidth. They can worry more about power efficiency and density instead.\\nThird point: sharing. A big part of the point of having individual desks in the office analogy, or per-core L1 caches, is that they\\u2019re private. If it\\u2019s on your private desk, you don\\u2019t need to ask anyone; you can just grab it.\\nThis is crucial. In the office analogy, if you were sharing a giant desk with 4 people, you can\\u2019t just grab a file. That\\u2019s not just your desk, and one of your other 3 co-workers might need that file right now (maybe they\\u2019re trying to cross-reference it with another file they just picked up at the other end of the desk!). Every single time you want to pick up something, you need to yell out \\u201ceveryone OK if I grab this?\\u201d, and if someone else wanted it first, you have to wait. Or you can have some scheme where everyone needs to grab a ticket and wait in line until it\\u2019s their turn if there\\u2019s a conflict. Or something else; the details don\\u2019t matter much here, but anything you do requires coordination with others. \\nThe same thing applies with multiple cores sharing a cache. You can\\u2019t just start stomping over data unannounced; anything you do in a shared cache needs to be coordinated with all the others you\\u2019re sharing it with.\\nThat\\u2019s why we have private L1 caches. The L1 cache is your \\u201cdesk\\u201d. While you\\u2019re sitting there, you can just go ahead and work. The L2 cache (\\u201cfiling cabinet\\u201d) handles most of the coordination with others. Most of the time, the worker (the CPU core) is sitting at the desk. Buster can just come by, pick up a list of new requests, and put previously requested files into the filing cabinet without interrupting the worker at all.\\nIt\\u2019s only when the worker and Buster want to access the filing cabinet at the same time, or when someone else has requested a file that\\u2019s lying on the worker\\u2019s desk, that they need to stop and talk to each other.\\nIn short, the L1 cache\\u2019s job is to serve its CPU core first and foremost. Because it\\u2019s private, it requires very little coordination. The L2 cache is still private to the CPU core, but along with just caching, it has an extra responsibility: deal with most bus traffic and communication instead of interrupting the core (which has better things to do).\\nThe L3 cache is a shared resource, and access to it does need to be coordinated globally. In the office analogy, this worked by the workers only having a single way to access it: namely, by going through Buster (the bus). The bus is a choke point; the hope is that the preceding two cache levels have winnowed down the number of memory accesses far enough that this doesn\\u2019t end up being a performance bottleneck.\\nCaveats\\nThis article covers one particular cache topology that is matches current desktop (and notebook) x86 CPUs: per-core split L1I/L1D caches, per-core unified L2 cache, shared unified L3 cache, with the cores connected via a ring bus.\\nNot every system looks like this. Some (primarily older) systems don\\u2019t have split instruction and data caches; some have full Harvard architectures that treat instruction and data memory as completely separate all the way through. Often L2s are shared between multiple cores (think one office with one filing cabinet and multiple desks). In this type of configuration, the L2 caches effectively act as part of the bus between cores. Many systems don\\u2019t have L3 caches, and some have both L3 and L4 caches! I also didn\\u2019t talk about systems with multiple CPU sockets etc.\\nI stuck with a ring bus because it fits in nicely with the analogy. Ring buses are reasonably common. Sometimes (especially when only two or three blocks need to be connected) it\\u2019s a full mesh; sometimes it is multiple ring buses connected with a crossbar (which maps reasonably to the office analogy: a multi-story office building with one \\u201cBuster\\u201d making his rounds per floor, and an elevator connecting the floors).\\nAs a software developer, there\\u2019s a natural tendency to assume that you can magically connect module A to module B and the data just teleports from one end to the other. The way memory actually works is incredibly complicated by now, but the abstraction presented to the programmer is just one of a large, flat array of bytes.\\nHardware doesn\\u2019t work like that. Pieces aren\\u2019t magically connected through an invisible ether. Modules A and B aren\\u2019t abstract concepts; they\\u2019re physical devices, actual tiny machines, that take up actual physical area on a silicon die. Chips have a \\u201cfloor plan\\u201d, and that\\u2019s not a vague nod or an in-joke; it\\u2019s an actual 2D map of what goes where. If you want to connect A to B, you need to run an actual, physical wire between them. Wires take up space, and driving them takes power (more the longer they are).

I can\\u2019t think of an obvious way to fit TLBs into the office analogy.\\nModern memory systems are often designed such that the TLB and L1 cache can be searched at the same time, with a final tag check to ensure that both the TLB and the L1 cache \\u201chit\\u201d. If you\\u2019re especially clever, you can engineer your TLB replacement policy to try to ensure that almost all of the time, a L1 cache hit implies a TLB hit. With a large unified cache, it\\u2019s difficult to see how you would do this.\\nUnless you wanted a unified TLB too? Or a much larger TLB which ensured that it covered all of the unified cache?

Thanks!\\nI wonder how much of that knowledge is still needed for developers?\\nOf course, it depends on the programming level you work with. If you use really low-level language: like C (C++) (not to mention asm), then it might be worthy to understand the mechanics. But even then compilers do a great job of optimizing things (C++). And if you use languages like Jave or .NET then you might even don\\u2019t have a chance to access such low-level stuff.\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfgiesen permalink\\n\\nMemory is one of the fundamental abstractions in computing, and the details of how it\\u2019s implemented \\u201cunder the hood\\u201d have major implications everywhere. In any language that compiles to machine code (be it ahead-of-time compiled C or even just-in-time compiled JavaScript!), cache-friendly data structures and algorithms frequently make a difference of an order of magnitude or more. (The difference is less pronounced with bytecode interpreters or similar, since the base overhead is larger.)\\nFor the most part, compilers can\\u2019t help you with this. In some fairly restricted cases (mostly dealing with very regular computations on large multidimensional arrays of numbers), some compilers can apply optimizations such as loop tiling that drastically affect cache behavior. Computations that fit the bill are few and far between in most programs.\\nFor the most part, it\\u2019s about choosing the right data structures and algorithms. Some languages really are high-level enough that the programmer only specifies the desired result and the exact implementation is up to the compiler (database query languages such as SQL or Datalog are an example), and such optimizations are possible. But the languages you mention (C++, Java, .NET languages such as C#) are not in that category. If you use a java.util.LinkedList in your classes\\u2019 interface, the compiler is not allowed to replace that with a java.util.ArrayList no matter how much it might want to. In .NET, there\\u2019s a distinction between reference and value types; they have different semantics, and they are also quite different in terms of memory access (reference types are always indirected through a pointer; value types are stored inline in their containing scope). Many of these are not things a compiler is allowed to change in your program; as a a general rule, most compilers have a lot of freedom about what they\\u2019re allowed to do inside a function (especially after inlining it into one of its callers), and are much more constrained when externally visible aspects such as method signatures or data types are concerned.\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBartek F. permalink\\n\\nThanks for the reply. Good points.\\nEven if you don\\u2019t unerstand how L1 works, you have to get a basic understanding of how memory works. And in that case data structures that are cache friendly (continous order in memory, local) wil lbe much better that just pointer to nodes scattered around the memory space.\\nSo, in general I think every programmer shoulw try to understand what CPU cache does, but I worry that too many people won\\u2019t care and just rely on compiler/tools.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeeraj Shukla permalink\\n\\nI intend to keep this in my L1 cache for sometime so that my brain can process, and totally understand it.\\nThis is very well explained.\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSumit Khanna permalink\\n\\nWow, this is an incredible post; takes me back to grad school and architecture class! I especially like the analogy where you talk about the desks being private. I also never thought about how instruction caches and data caches are separate (at least in the x86/64 world), which makes a lot of sense.\\nSo much of what we do as engineers is built on layers and layers of abstraction. There\\u2019s a photo (which I can\\u2019t find at the moment) of dune buggy tied to a flatbed truck which is sitting inside of a small box truck which is inside a semi-truck. It\\u2019s a perfect example of encapsulation. We depend on all those layers to work together, but most people don\\u2019t have a good understanding of what\\u2019s really going on.\\nAt least in the network/services world, we throw around the term \\u201cfull-stack\\u201d today for people who can at least setup the stuff they work on from start to finish (and if you can automate it, you get into the \\u201cdev-ops\\u201d world as well). Where security problems are found are where we find breaks between these layers of encapsulation. \\nEven for developers who may never touch machine architecture, analogies like this really help to build a high level understanding of very complex systems.\\nWhen we find edge cases that allow us to break those contracts between layers, we can find exploits. If we can break one of those straps; say the one holding flatbed to the box truck, all the other layers of straps and safety can break, causing the entire thing to come falling out the back.\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfgiesen permalink\\n\\nSeparate instruction and data caches (along with first-level instruction/data TLBs when paging is supported) are common everywhere, not just on x86. Common ARMs, POWERs/PowerPCs, MIPSs, SPARCs etc. do the same thing.\\nIt\\u2019s a very natural subdivision in any pipelined processor, because instruction fetches have to happen every single cycle (as long as the core isn\\u2019t stalled), they generally have a different working set from data, and they happen many pipeline stages earlier than data cache accesses do.

You can buy cores with anything between 0 (e.g. ARM Cortex-M0) and 4 (e.g. Intel Broadwell-C) numbered levels of cache these days, and a case can be made that the uOp cache in Broadwell-C effectively acts as \\u201cL0 instruction cache\\u201d, bringing the number of cache levels up to 5. :)\\nDon\\u2019t get attached to any particular detail too much. The example chosen is nice in that having 3 cache levels allows me to show different organizations (private L2 connected to a shared bus, shared L3) for the higher cache levels. The interesting point here is not so much the particular decisions themselves, but what underlying trade-offs drive them: the most important one definitely is that you want private L1 caches so your cores can (for the most part) proceed uninterrupted, with the higher cache levels handling most of the communication. Beyond that, it\\u2019s instructive to look at real-world designs, but I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019ll get a lot out of doctoring the metaphor to fit.\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlogztechstuff permalink\\n\\nVery well explained sir, liked the example very much which helped to understand level of cache easily and precisely,\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe 8th mage permalink\\n\\ncan you talk about what in this ananlogy is the two or 40 hands that the secretery have that are called hyperthreading? do they share the same desk most of the time or do they have different desks?\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe 8th mage permalink\\n\\nthe 40 was because fiora aeterna told me that it happens in gpu. of course cpu hyperthreading is more like 2 than 40.\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfgiesen permalink\\n\\nHyperthreading is a single worker on a single desk that is time-slicing his work between two (or more) cases, switching to work on another case when some file he needs for his current case isn\\u2019t on hand.\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTodor permalink\\n\\nCurrent hyperthreading implementations just stuff instructions in the same pipeline and tags them with thread 0/1, and splits them on write.

Thanks for the very illuminating answer. One reason I asked it was that I was under the (clearly incorrect) impression that accesses from one part of a CPU chip to another would take place at roughly the same speed. Is this actually true, but the requirements of a multicore cache coherency within a processor add enough overhead that it isn\\u2019t true in practice?\\nI also remember the days when some cache levels weren\\u2019t on the CPU chip at all \\u2013 they were on the motherboard. Accessing them was still faster than accessing RAM. Things are simpler now.\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfgiesen permalink\\n\\nMaintaining cache coherency usually does not make things much slower at all. More precisely, the implementations of it you see in the real world don\\u2019t, because chip makers are willing to throw a considerable amount of clever engineering at the problem of making the average memory operation fast (even if that does make contented operations somewhat slower). The crucial point is that most memory accesses don\\u2019t experience contention. The fast paths don\\u2019t end up doing much more work than a regular cache in a single-processor system (with no other cores to worry about) would, and the slow paths are taking rarely, unless the core you\\u2019re running does bad things (like having all cores contend on the same lock), in which case performance will tank badly. :)\\nA big factor in the higher cache levels being slower is simply that they\\u2019re larger, farther away, and reaching them usually requires passing through a few stages of buffering.\\nModern CPUs are clocked fast enough, and the propagation speed of electrical signals in them is slow enough \\u2013 which is to say, a small enough fraction of the speed of light :) \\u2013 that you can\\u2019t round-trip a signal from one corner of the chip to the opposite end within a single clock cycle. For the outermost wire layers, you apparently get about 1/4 c. At 4GHz for a high end desktop CPU, your cycle time is 0.25ns. At that speed, that means your signal can travel (on the fastest metal layers!) about 18.7mm within a single clock cycle. That\\u2019s one way. If you want a reply back, and assuming the recipient replies instantaneously (not realistic), you need to travel the same distance back \\u2013 so you get about 9.4mm.\\nNext, let\\u2019s consider the size of the chips in question. According to AnandTech, an Intel Skylake GT2 4C CPU die measures about 9mm\\u00d713.5mm (and that\\u2019s on the small end for a desktop chip, as they note). As you can see that\\u2019s too large to manage a round-trip in a single cycle. And that\\u2019s purely considering propagation delay; there are other factors too.\\nLarge caches take a while to access. Part of this is simply propagation delay from distance traveled \\u2013 some of it within the cache, some to get to the cache (and back). Another part is addressing the cache, e.g. taking the address bits and figuring out which row of the cache they correspond too. That\\u2019s a few logic ops per row (more for larger caches because there\\u2019s more address bits participating in that computation), and they add their part of the delay. Yet another factor is that caches often are in a different clock domain than at least some of the things they\\u2019re connected to, and cache accesses are generally not done directly; they go through a queue first, which both acts as a buffer for potential clock speed transitions and helps smooth over bursty access patterns. They also add extra delay, though.\\nAnother big one is that the caches really are built quite differently. For example, Intel likes to use so-called VIPT (virtually indexed, physically tagged) L1 data caches. Without going into too much detail, L1 data caches are usually N-way set associative, which means that for every address, there\\u2019s N possible locations in the cache where it can be stored. For the last few generations, Intel has used N=8 in their L1 caches. Now, each cache line stores both its contents and a \\u201ctag\\u201d, which stores the address for the cache line being kept there. These are usually physical memory addresses, not the virtual memory addresses user-mode programs commonly deal with. Now, virtual addresses have to be translated to physical addresses before a memory access can happen; there\\u2019s another type of cache, the TLB, that handles this bit (TLBs are by now built as multi-level caches as well). But first completing the translation, then performing the access would be slow. A VIPT cache computes the index (which determines which N possible locations to look at) from the virtual address, so the memory access can start before the corresponding physical address is even known.\\nFor the last few generations, Intel has had 8-way associative L1 data caches with 32KB size. The index is computed from the lower address bits \\u2013 32KB/8 = 4KB, the smallest supported page size on x86, which is the granularity of virtual memory remapping. Because the index is computed from the lower virtual address bits that don\\u2019t get remapped under the address translation, these lower address bits also match the corresponding physical address bits. The only problems is that we don\\u2019t yet know which of the 8 different potential locations the data we need is in \\u2013 so the cache \\u201csimply\\u201d fetches all 8! The rest of the address translation proceeds in parallel, and once the right physical address is known, the correct copy (of the 8 fetched), is sent outwards to the load/store unit. This kind of trickery shaves something like 1-2 cycles of precious latency off the L1 data access time. It\\u2019s worth it there, but nowhere else. By the time a L2 fetch happens (after a L1 miss), the physical address is known; and in a L2 (or later) access path, you\\u2019ll generally probe the tags first, to figure out which way (\\u201cways\\u201d are how the N possible locations for a given address are called) to access, and then only get that one copy of the data. Doing the tag lookup before rather than in parallel with the data lookup is slower but also a lot more power-efficient (among other things), and L2 (and higher) caches don\\u2019t need to squeeze every single cycle the way L1 caches do.\\nThere\\u2019s plenty more things like that. :)\\nNote that most of these are purely increases in latency; even when a signal takes a few cycles to reach the destination, that doesn\\u2019t mean you can\\u2019t change it every cycle if you want to; it just takes a while for the data to propagate from one end to the other.\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe 8th colored mage permalink\\n\\nHi ryg, it\\u2019s a little off topic, but is the Istruction cache has the same security mechanism as the L1 Data cache? i would have thought not necessarily, for the common use is that the code stays pretty much constant, but when i looked at the disassembly of FlushInstructionCache(otherProcess,\\u2026) i saw that all it does is return true. i am thinking it\\u2019s a legacy function from times or from a different arch where the instruction cache didn\\u2019t have those protections.\\nwell, i kinda care about it because writing a debugger has a lot of changing the code binary, and i don\\u2019t know if i should still call FlushInstructionCache or not?\\nthanks\\nThe 8th mage.\\n\\nReply \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfgiesen permalink\\n\\nWhat do you mean by \\u201csecurity mechanism\\u201d here?

Eventually, they agreed, and under the guidance of lead engineer Walther Bauersfeld, Zeiss created something amazing.The use of models to show the movements of the planets and stars goes back centuries, starting with mechanical orreries that used clockwork mechanisms to depict our solar system. A modern upgrade was Clair Omar Musser\\u2019s desktop electric orrery, which he designed for the Seattle World\\u2019s Fair in 1962. The projector that Zeiss planned for the Deutsches Museum would be far more elaborate. For starters, there would be two planetariums. One would showcase the Copernican, or heliocentric, sky, displaying the stars and planets as they revolved around the sun. The other would show the Ptolemaic, or geocentric, sky, with the viewer fully immersed in the view, as if standing on the surface of the Earth, seemingly at the center of the universe. The task of realizing those ideas fell to Bauersfeld, a mechanical engineer by training and a managing director at Zeiss. Zeiss engineer Walther Bauersfeld worked out the electromechanical details of the planetarium. In this May 1920 entry from his lab notebook [right], he sketched the two-axis system for showing the daily and annual motions of the stars.ZEISS ArchiveAt first, Bauersfeld focused on projecting just the sun, moon, and planets of our solar system. At the suggestion of his boss, Rudolf Straubel, he added stars. World War I interrupted the work, but by 1920 Bauersfeld was back at it. One entry in May 1920 in Bauersfeld\\u2019s meticulous lab notebook showed the earliest depiction of the two-axis design that allowed for the display of the daily as well as the annual motions of the stars. (The notebook is preserved in the Zeiss Archive.)The planetarium projector was in fact a concatenation of many smaller projectors and a host of gears. According to the Zeiss Archive, a large sphere held all of the projectors for the fixed stars as well as a \\u201cplanet cage\\u201d that held projectors for the sun, the moon, and the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The fixed-star sphere was positioned so that it projected outward from the exact center of the dome. The planetarium also had projectors for the Milky Way and the names of major constellations. The projectors within the planet cage were organized in tiers with complex gearing that allowed a motorized drive to move them around one axis to simulate the annual rotations of these celestial objects against the backdrop of the stars. The entire projector could also rotate around a second axis, simulating the Earth\\u2019s polar axis, to show the rising and setting of the sun, moon, and planets over the horizon. The Zeiss planetarium projected onto a spherical surface, which consisted of a geodesic steel lattice overlaid with concrete.Zeiss ArchiveBauersfeld also contributed to the design of the surrounding projection dome, which achieved its exactly spherical surface by way of a geodesic network of steel rods covered by a thin layer of concrete. Planetariums catch on worldwideThe first demonstration of what became known as the Zeiss Model I projector took place on 21 October 1923 before the Deutsches Museum committee in their not-yet-completed building, in Munich. \\u201cThis planetarium is a marvel,\\u201d von Miller declared in an administrative report. In 1924, public demonstrations of the Zeiss planetarium took place on the roof of the company\\u2019s factory in Jena, Germany.ZEISS ArchiveThe projector then returned north to Jena for further adjustments and testing. The company also began offering demonstrations of the projector in a makeshift dome on the roof of its factory. From July to September 1924, more than 30,000 visitors experienced the Zeisshimmel (Zeiss sky) this way. These demonstrations became informal visitor-experience studies and allowed Zeiss and the museum to make refinements and improvements. On 7 May 1925, the world\\u2019s first projection planetarium officially opened to the public at the Deutsches Museum. The Zeiss Model I displayed 4,500 stars, the band of the Milky Way, the sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Gears and motors moved the projector to replicate the changes in the sky as Earth rotated on its axis and revolved around the sun. Visitors viewed this simulation of the night sky from the latitude of Munich and in the comfort of a climate-controlled building, although at first chairs were not provided. (I get a crick in the neck just thinking about it.) The projector was bolted to the floor, but later versions were mounted on rails to move them back and forth. A presenter operated the machine and lectured on astronomical topics, pointing out constellations and the orbits of the planets. Word of the Zeiss planetarium spread quickly, through postcards and images.ZEISS ArchiveThe planetarium\\u2019s influence quickly extended far beyond Germany, as museums and schools around the world incorporated the technology into immersive experiences for science education and public outreach. Each new planetarium was greeted with curiosity and excitement. Postcards and images of planetariums (both the distinctive domed buildings and the complicated machines) circulated widely. In 1926, Zeiss opened its own planetarium in Jena based on Bauersfeld\\u2019s specifications. The first city outside of Germany to acquire a Zeiss planetarium was Vienna. It opened in a temporary structure on 7 May 1927 and in a permanent structure four years later, only to be destroyed during World War II. The Zeiss planetarium in Rome, which opened in 1928, projected the stars onto the domed vault of the 3rd-century Aula Ottagona, part of the ancient Baths of Diocletian. The first planetarium in the western hemisphere opened in Chicago in May 1930. Philanthropist Max Adler, a former executive at Sears, contributed funds to the building that now bears his name. He called it a \\u201cclassroom under the heavens.\\u201d Japan\\u2019s first planetarium, a Zeiss Model II, opened in Osaka in 1937 at the Osaka City Electricity Science Museum. As its name suggests, the museum showcased exhibits on electricity, funded by the municipal power company. The city council had to be convinced of the educational value of the planetarium. But the mayor and other enthusiasts supported it. The planetarium operated for 50 years.Who doesn\\u2019t love a planetarium?After World War II and the division of Germany, the Zeiss company also split in two, with operations continuing at Oberkochen in the west and Jena in the east. Both branches continued to develop the planetarium through the Zeiss Model VI before shifting the nomenclature to more exotic names, such as the Spacemaster, Skymaster, and Cosmorama. The two large spheres of the Zeiss Model II, introduced in 1926, displayed the skies of the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. Each sphere contained a number of smaller projectors.ZEISS ArchiveOver the years, refinements included increased precision, the addition of more stars, automatic controls that allowed the programming of complete shows, and a shift to fiber optics and LED lighting. Zeiss still produces planetariums in a variety of configurations for different size domes.Today more than 4,000 planetariums are in operation globally. A planetarium is often the first place where children connect what they see in the night sky to a broader science and an understanding of the universe. My hometown of Richmond, Va., opened its first planetarium in April 1983 at the Science Museum of Virginia. That was a bit late in the big scheme of things, but just in time to wow me as a kid. I still remember the first show I saw, narrated by an animatronic Mark Twain with a focus on the 1986 visit of Halley\\u2019s Comet. By then the museum also had a giant OmniMax screen that let me soar over the Grand Canyon, watch beavers transform the landscape, and swim with whale sharks, all from the comfort of my reclining seat. No wonder the museum is where I got my start as a public historian of science and technology. I began volunteering there at age 14 and have never looked back.

Pulumi is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform that simplifies resource management across any cloud or SaaS provider, including Docker. Pulumi providers are integrations with useful tools and vendors. Pulumi\\u2019s new Docker Build provider is about making your builds even easier, faster, and more reliable.\\u00a0 In this post, we will dive into how Pulumi\\u2019s new Docker Build provider works with Docker Build Cloud to streamline building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. First, we\\u2019ll set up a project using Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi. Then, we\\u2019ll explore cool use cases that showcase how you can leverage this provider to simplify your build and deployment pipelines. \\u00a0  Pulumi Docker Build provider features Top features of the Pulumi Docker Build provider include the following:  Docker Build Cloud support: Offload your builds to the cloud and free up your local resources. Faster builds mean fewer headaches. Multi-platform support: Build Docker images that work on different hardware architectures without breaking a sweat. Advanced caching: Say goodbye to redundant builds. In addition to the shared caching available when you use Docker Build Cloud, this provider supports multiple cache backends, like Amazon S3, GitHub Actions, and even local disk, to keep your builds efficient. Flexible export options: Customize where your Docker images go after they\\u2019re built \\u2014 export to registries, filesystems, or wherever your workflow needs.  Getting started with Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi\\u00a0\\u00a0 Docker Build Cloud is Docker\\u2019s newest offering that provides a pair of AMD and Arm builders in the cloud and shared cache for your team, resulting in up to 39x faster image builds. Docker Personal, Pro, Team, and Business plans include a set number of Build Cloud minutes, or you can purchase a Build Cloud Team plan to add minutes. Learn more about Docker Build Cloud plans.\\u00a0 The example builds an NGINX Dockerfile using a Docker Build Cloud builder. We will create a Docker Build Cloud builder, create a Pulumi program in Typescript, and build our image. Prerequisites  Docker Pulumi CLI Pulumi Cloud account (Individual free tier works) A Pulumi-supported language Docker Build Cloud Team plan or a Docker Core Subscription with available Docker Build Cloud minutes  Step 1: Set up your Docker Build Cloud builder Building images locally means being subject to local compute and storage availability. Pulumi allows users to build images with Docker Build Cloud. The Pulumi Docker Build provider fully supports Docker Build Cloud, which unlocks new capabilities, as individual team members or a CI/CD pipeline can fully take advantage of improved build speeds, shared build cache, and native multi-platform builds. If you still need to create a builder, follow the steps below; otherwise, skip to step 1C. A. Log in to your Docker Build Cloud account. B. Create a new cloud builder named my-cool-builder.\\u00a0 Figure 1: Create the new cloud builder and call it my-cool-builder. C. In your local machine, sign in to your Docker account. $ docker login D. Add your existing cloud builder endpoint. $ docker buildx create --driver cloud ORG/BUILDER_NAME\\n# Replace ORG with the Docker Hub namespace of your Docker organization. \\n# This creates a builder named cloud-ORG-BUILDER_NAME.\\n\\n# Example:\\n$ docker buildx create --driver cloud pulumi/my-cool-builder\\n# cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder\\n\\n# check your new builder is configured\\n$ docker buildx ls\\n E. Optionally, see that your new builder is available in Docker Desktop. Figure 2: The Builders view in the Docker Desktop settings lists all available local and Docker Build Cloud builders available to the logged-in account. For additional guidance on setting up Docker Build Cloud, refer to the Docker docs. Step 2: Set up your Pulumi project To create your first Pulumi project, start with a Pulumi template. Pulumi has curated hundreds of templates that are directly integrated with the Pulumi CLI via pulumi new. In particular, the Pulumi team has created a Pulumi template for Docker Build Cloud to get you started. The Pulumi programming model centers around defining infrastructure using popular programming languages. This approach allows you to leverage existing programming tools and define cloud resources using familiar syntaxes such as loops and conditionals. To copy the Pulumi template locally: $ pulumi new https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/dockerbuildcloud-ts --dir hello-dbc\\n# project name: hello-dbc \\n# project description: (default)\\n# stack name: dev\\n# Note: Update the builder value to match yours\\n# builder: cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder \\n$ cd hello-dbc\\n\\n# update all npm packages (recommended)\\n$ npm update --save\\n Optionally, explore your Pulumi program. The hello-dbc folder has everything you need to build a Dockerfile into an image with Pulumi. Your Pulumi program starts with an entry point, typically a function written in your chosen programming language. This function defines the infrastructure resources and configurations for your project. For TypeScript, that file is index.ts, and the contents are shown below: import * as dockerBuild from \\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\";\\nimport * as pulumi from \\\"@pulumi/pulumi\\\";\\n\\nconst config = new pulumi.Config();\\nconst builder = config.require(\\\"builder\\\");\\n\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\"image\\\", {\\n\\n   // Configures the name of your existing buildx builder to use.\\n   // See the Pulumi.<stack>.yaml project file for the builder configuration.\\n   builder: {\\n       name: builder, // Example, \\\"cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder\\\",\\n   },\\n   context: {\\n       location: \\\"app\\\",\\n   },\\n   // Enable exec to run a custom docker-buildx binary with support\\n   // for Docker Build Cloud (DBC).\\n   exec: true,\\n   push: false,\\n});\\n Step 3: Build your Docker image Run the pulumi up command to see the image being built with the newly configured builder: $ pulumi up --yes\\n You can follow the browser link to the Pulumi Cloud dashboard and navigate to the Image resource to confirm it\\u2019s properly configured by noting the builder parameter. Figure 3: Navigate to the Image resource to check the configuration. Optionally, also check your Docker Build Cloud dashboard for build minutes usage: Figure 4: The build.docker.com view shows the user has selected the Cloud builders from the left menu and the product dashboard is shown on the right side. Congratulations! You have built an NGINX Dockerfile with Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi. This was achieved by creating a new Docker Build Cloud builder and passing that to a Pulumi template. The Pulumi CLI is then used to deploy the changes. Advanced use cases with buildx and BuildKit To showcase popular buildx and BuildKit features, test one or more of the following Pulumi code samples. These include multi-platform, advanced caching,\\u00a0 and exports. Note that each feature is available as an input (or parameter) in the Pulumi Docker Build Image resource.\\u00a0 Multi-platform image builds for Docker Build Cloud Docker images can support multiple platforms, meaning a single image may contain variants for architectures and operating systems.\\u00a0 The following code snippet is analogous to invoking a build from the Docker CLI with the --platform flag to specify the target platform for the build output. import * as dockerBuild from \\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\";\\n\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\"image\\\", {\\n   // Build a multi-platform image manifest for ARM and AMD.\\n   platforms: [\\n       dockerBuild.Platform.Linux_amd64,\\n       dockerBuild.Platform.Linux_arm64,\\n   ],\\n   push: false,\\n\\n});\\n Deploy the changes made to the Pulumi program: $ pulumi up --yes\\n Caching from and to AWS ECR Maintaining cached layers while building Docker images saves precious time by enabling faster builds. However, utilizing cached layers has been historically challenging in CI/CD pipelines due to recycled environments between builds. The cacheFrom and cacheTo parameters allow programmatic builds to optimize caching behavior.\\u00a0 Update your Docker image resource to take advantage of caching: import * as dockerBuild from \\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\";\\nimport * as pulumi from \\\"@pulumi/pulumi\\\";\\nimport * as aws from \\\"@pulumi/aws\\\"; // Required for ECR\\n\\n// Create an ECR repository for pushing.\\nconst ecrRepository = new aws.ecr.Repository(\\\"ecr-repository\\\", {});\\n\\n// Grab auth credentials for ECR.\\nconst authToken = aws.ecr.getAuthorizationTokenOutput({\\n   registryId: ecrRepository.registryId,\\n});\\n\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\"image\\\", {\\n   push: true,\\n   // Use the pushed image as a cache source.\\n   cacheFrom: [{\\n       registry: {\\n           ref: pulumi.interpolate`${ecrRepository.repositoryUrl}:cache`,\\n       },\\n   }],\\n   cacheTo: [{\\n       registry: {\\n           imageManifest: true,\\n           ociMediaTypes: true,\\n           ref: pulumi.interpolate`${ecrRepository.repositoryUrl}:cache`,\\n       },\\n   }],\\n   // Provide our ECR credentials.\\n   registries: [{\\n       address: ecrRepository.repositoryUrl,\\n       password: authToken.password,\\n       username: authToken.userName,\\n   }],\\n})\\n Notice the declaration of additional resources for AWS ECR.\\u00a0 Export builds as a tar file Exporting allows us to share or back up the resulting image from a build invocation.\\u00a0 To export the build as a local .tar file, modify your resource to include the exports Input: const image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\"image\\\", {\\n   push: false,\\n   exports: [{\\n       docker: {\\n           tar: true,\\n       },\\n   }],\\n})\\n Deploy the changes made to the Pulumi program: $ pulumi up --yes\\n Review the Pulumi Docker Build provider guide to explore other Docker Build features, such as build arguments, build contexts, remote contexts, and more. Next steps Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is key to managing modern cloud-native development, and Docker lets developers create and control images with Dockerfiles and Docker Compose files. But when the situation gets more complex, like deploying across different cloud platforms, Pulumi can offer additional flexibility and advanced infrastructure features. The Docker Build provider supports Docker Build Cloud, streamlining building, deploying, and managing containerized applications, which helps development teams work together more effectively and maintain agility. Pulumi\\u2019s latest Docker Build provider, powered by BuildKit, improves flexibility and efficiency in Docker builds. By applying IaC principles, developers manage infrastructure with code, even in intricate scenarios. This means you can focus on building and deploying your containerized workloads without the hassle of complex infrastructure challenges.

This happened with multiple searches and will probably get even worse as the time goes on.\\nExample\\nFor example search AWS Lightsail xray, brings up this AI Answer from Pulumi as the top result:\\n\\nLink to the AI Answer: https://www.pulumi.com/ai/answers/bLHAi4DutXJvbJyNngGRvS/optimizing-aws-lightsail-and-x-ray-deployment.\\nWhile this might seem like a good thing for someone, spamming high ranked results that are at best misleading and at worst destructive does not seem like something I would want to associate Pulumi as a brand. There's already tons of generated, false content available on the internet and adding even more noise to the search results is not a good idea.\\nI would highly recommend Disallow:ing robots from scraping https://www.pulumi.com/ai/answers via Robots.txt or similar functionality.\\nAdditional context\\nAdding -inurl:[pulumi.com/ai] to your query will remove Pulumi AI answers from the search results, but it's cumbersome.\\nContributing\\nVote on this issue by adding a \\ud83d\\udc4d reaction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ud83d\\udc4d\\n163\\n akx, joneteus, jhirvioja, anttispitkanen, happosade, ilmarivacklinsc, timiwahalahti, vvalkonen, mieky, HelloFillip, and 153 more reacted with thumbs up emoji\\n\\n\\n \\nAll reactions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udc4d\\n163 reactions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npetetnt\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          added\\n      \\n\\n  kind/bug\\n\\nSome behavior is incorrect or out of spec\\n\\n  needs-triage\\n\\nNeeds attention from the triage team\\n\\n  labels\\n\\n\\n    Mar 21, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n            Copy link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMember\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAaronFriel\\n\\n\\n      \\n\\n      commented\\n\\n\\n        Mar 22, 2024\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          edited by cnunciato\\n          \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHey @petetnt, we've taken this feedback from you and others and we've taken steps to remove more than half (almost two thirds) of AI Answers, and we plan to continue to ensure that these AI answers are complementary to our existing documentation.\\nWe are also taking steps to:\\n\\nEnsure our pages are grounded in the real APIs and upstream documentation\\nValidating the results, e.g.: via type checking and testing the generated code\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ud83d\\udc4d\\n15\\n happosade, wolverian, mieky, joonakilpinen, shstkvch, XeroOl, dvaun, mikejk8s, lfuelling, drakmail, and 5 more reacted with thumbs up emoji\\n\\n\\n \\nAll reactions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udc4d\\n15 reactions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAaronFriel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        removed\\n  the \\n\\n  needs-triage\\n\\nNeeds attention from the triage team\\n label\\n\\n\\n    Mar 22, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAaronFriel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        assigned     AaronFriel and     interurban\\nMar 22, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n            Copy link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMember\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncnunciato\\n\\n\\n      \\n\\n      commented\\n\\n\\n        Mar 22, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwe've taken steps to remove more than half of AI Answers\\n\\nWorth mentioning this list was submitted to Google this morning, so it could be a bit before they're removed from search results.

In short: we've gotten very positive feedback users when the pages show up appropriately and don't clutter the first page of results in a search engine. We don't want to throw out the good with the bad, and we've marked those pages as noindex. The URL Inspection tool reports what we expect since setting these pages to 404:\\n\\nI'll speak to @tobytteh's comment here, which I think captures the frustration folks have and the underlying question of why we Pulumi feels comfortable generating code examples with AI:\\n\\nThis use of AI is monstrously stupid. Let us all pray to our respective gods that someone at Pulumi is intelligent enough to end this.\\n\\nCode generation is Pulumi's bread and butter, it is a core competency of our engineering org. Every one of our providers has a rich schema describing the SDK (example Docker provider schema.json). Those schemas are then used to generate the SDKs for each language (source code in github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pkg/codegen). Pulumi AI combines this with retrieval augmented generation and type checking of generated programs to be more than ten times more likely to generate valid, working code for many questions than ChatGPT (GPT-4) on its own. Generating ten times better code than state of the art language models is itself a feat, but we aren't resting on our laurels and we're continuing to work on setting an even higher bar for ourselves to ensure that every program we publish would work from copy-and-paste to pulumi up.\\nThat said, we certainly didn't expect the result of publishing as many pages as we did, and that's why we've taken drastic steps to withdraw a significant number (around 2/3) of the AI Answers. We'll continue to raise the bar on quality and prune pages that do not meet our standards.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nAll reactions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n            Copy link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npetetnt\\n\\n\\n      \\n\\n      commented\\n\\n\\n        May 7, 2024\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          edited\\n          \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonally I don\\u2019t think the (alledged) 2/3rds is nearly good enough ratio to spam the internet full of absolutely wrong answers. Not to mention the page mentioned in the first post is still up and indexed for example, which makes me think that you are willing to risk it for a piece of the much obsessed AI pie.\\nFor example publishing an index of valid answers while keeping the actual index out the results would probably satisfy those looking for AI answers too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nAll reactions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\\n  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n            Copy link\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMember\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAaronFriel\\n\\n\\n      \\n\\n      commented\\n\\n\\n        May 7, 2024\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n          edited\\n          \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the interest of transparency, I'm happy to set up a call to chat and prove that 2/3 figure.

These build upon and extend our rich Pulumi Deployments foundation for deployment orchestration and workflow. This is an exciting, customer-driven release, with new features that help with Day 2 operations and management.These new features are:Drift Detection and Remediation - Continuously detect and remediate driftTime-to-Live Stacks - Clean up stale infrastructure automaticallyScheduled Deployments - Automate recurring workflows on a scheduleFree Deployments Minutes - Use all of the above for free, no matter your tier!We built these features based on customer feedback, and our 2,500+ customers are excited:\\u201cAt Oleria, we understand the importance of addressing issues with privacy, security, and data integrity. Earning and maintaining our trust isn\\u2019t just a responsibility but a fundamental aspect of our mission,\\u201d said Jim Alkove, CEO of Oleria. \\u201cPulumi also understands how these attributes affect cloud infrastructure. Our team is excited to use these new capabilities, giving us even more confidence as we enable our customers to securely manage access to decentralized SaaS applications, adaptively and intelligently.\\u201dThese advanced features are available today in the Enterprise and Business Critical editions of Pulumi Cloud. These features together enable an end-to-end experience for managing the lifecycle and consistency of your cloud infrastructure to ensure enterprises have the capabilities needed to operate at scale.Infrastructure Lifecycle Management Capabilities - Excelling at Day 2 and BeyondSo, why infrastructure lifecycle management?Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is table stakes for our customers. It helps to ensure Day 1, 2, and beyond cloud practices are robust, secure, and dependable. However, operational realities mean that sometimes teams need more flexibility than what strict IaC and Git-driven deployments offer.For example, maybe you need to break glass and interact with the AWS console directly to open up SSH to an EC2 instance in order to debug a gnarly issue. Or maybe you need to scale up your Auto Scaling group (ASG) temporarily while a live-site incident of unexpected traffic peaks plays out. Or maybe someone added tags to your resource without knowing it was under the management of Pulumi. This can lead to drift, where your IaC configuration no longer matches reality, and reality no longer matches your IaC. This is where Drift Detection and Remediation comes in to automatically report on and reconcile it.Alternatively, you may want to enable self-service infrastructure provisioning for your entire team, including developers and data scientists, who are not infrastructure experts. But what if they forget to wind things down when they\\u2019re done? You are left spending valuable money and resources managing infrastructure that\\u2019s no longer needed. Time-to-Live Stacks automatically reclaim such ephemeral infrastructure, enabling self-serve with confidence.Next up, we often want to deploy on a Git commit, which Pulumi Deployments already handles. However, what if we want more flexibility around how and when deployments occur? For instance, perhaps you\\u2019re a retailer who doesn\\u2019t want to deploy on Black Friday. Or maybe you prefer to deploy at set times throughout the week rather than on every Git commit. This is where Scheduled Deployments comes in, to give us flexible cron-based scheduling of deployments.Finally, we want everyone to be able to kick the tires with all of the above, no commitments needed. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019re also announcing today that all users \\u2013 individuals, teams, and enterprises alike \\u2013 get an allotment of free monthly deployment minutes to use all of this.Get started now for free at app.pulumi.com. We can\\u2019t wait to hear what you think!Happy cloud spelunking.featuresinfrastructure-lifecycle-managementSubscribe to the Pulumi Monthly NewsletterEnter your email*Last UTM MediumLast UTM CampaignLast UTM SourceShare this post\\nGet StartedInstallDocumentationRegistryPublic RoadmapSecurityEnterpriseAWSAzureGoogle CloudContainersServerlessKubernetesAbout UsRequest a DemoTalk to a humanSupportCareersResourcesSlack ArchiveCase StudiesAwards & RecognitionsBrand ResourcesYour Website PreferencesSign up for our newsletterEnter your email*Last UTM MediumLast UTM CampaignLast UTM SourceTrademark UsageAcceptable Use PolicyTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyProfessional Services Agreement\\u00a9 Pulumi 2024We use cookies (and other similar technologies) to collect data to improve your experience on our site.

(Unless The Stack is sorely mistaken, \\\"Cloud Manager\\\" is a lick of Oracle paint on an underlying open source Terraform engine; or was... )Oracle\\u2019s OpenTofu shiftIn a short blog, an EBS product director at Oracle said that its \\u201clatest Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Cloud Manager update, 24.1.1.1, is now available,\\u201d urging customers to update \\u201cat your earliest convenience.\\u201d\\u201cIn this release, we have switched from Terraform to OpenTofu due to forthcoming Terraform licensing changes,\\u201d wrote Terri Noyes.\\u201c You must therefore upgrade your Cloud Manager to 24.1.1.1 by June 30, 2024 at the latest,\\u201d she said, adding that the release updated further components to \\u201cmaintain security standards and improve supportability.\\u201dThe move comes after Hashicorp\\u2019s 2023 decision to adopt a more restrictive BSL 1.1. Licence for Terraform and other products, instead of the MPL 2.0 that it previously used. That move triggered a swift fork, OpenTofu, adopted by the Linux Foundation. (Version 1.7 landed in March 2024 and was widely considered to be the first enterprise-ready version.)Oracle\\u2019s move seems like a straightforward decision to ensure it is using the most permissive underlying IaC tool without having to worry about downstream licence complications, no more and no less. OpenTofu is essentially a pretty familiar drop-in replacement for Terraform; using it here is ultimately a minor implementation detail for those looking to move complex EBS environments to the cloud, but it does signal that serious enterprises feel the fork is already robust enough to use.\\u00a0In late April IBM agreed to buy Hashicorp for $6.7 billion.\\u00a0See also: \\\"Red Hash\\\"?

When I first heard the rumours yesterday, I was concerned about the future of possibly my favourite Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool. It has long been obvious that Hashicorp has been struggling to make money, making a $274 million loss in 2023. This undoubtedly led to the highly controversial switch to the BSL license in August 2023 and the community fork of OpenTofu. Hashicorp is hardly alone in its struggles, with Redis adopting a similar approach, resulting in the Valkey fork or Elasticsearch with its license changes.The challenge of open-source monetisationFundamentally, many of these companies have struggled to sufficiently monetise the open-source tools they have developed, and this is where I want to bust a myth some people seem to have:There is no such thing as \\u2018free\\u2019 softwareSure, there is plenty of software that is free at the point of use and can be modified under permissive licenses and the like, but fundamentally, developers are spending time writing code, and time typically requires some payment.Source: https://accidentalastro.com/2022/12/will-code-for-food/I appreciate there are several hobby projects that people may contribute to in their spare time, but large open-source projects are typically supported by big tech firms contributing engineers or money to enable developers to work part or full-time on them; for example, look at the companies who pay to be members of the Linux foundation. As another example, Google is still the largest single contributor to the Kubernetes project. Google can do this because it makes money running services that rely on it, and sells a managed offering in Google Kubernetes Engine.Source: https://www.cncf.io/reports/kubernetes-project-journey-report/Hashicorp struggles with this, people have long used their free tool to orchestrate public and private cloud environments but had little reason to pay for the Terraform Cloud product even if it had some advantages.The problem with IBM buying HashicorpSource: https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2024/04/967925a7-hashicorp-ibm.jpgSo Hashicorp was a financial disaster even though they had good products, I have personally worked with Terraform & Packer and seen plenty of Vault implementations. A lot of companies liked Hashicorp tooling because it was inherently cloud-agnostic; for multi-cloud organisations, having a common configuration language in Terraform or a secret management solution in Vault was preferable to learning each in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or the multitude of other providers.This leads me to my first concern, IBM has a conflict of interest. IBM has a cloud offering, admittedly with a 1.8% market share. Why would they want to keep developing tools that frankly benefit their competitors more than them?My second concern, perhaps my biggest, is that IBM has a graveyard of failed acquisitions of good software companies. In recent history, their acquisition of Red Hat resulted in changes to CentOS that destroyed the market share of this once-popular distribution, anecdotally often in favour of Ubuntu LTS. This is far from the only example with Lotus Software being another from the 2000s. I simply have no trust in IBM to look after Hashicorp as a company.So, where do we go from here?Source: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQG7bJnXPlbrsw/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1520066260072?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=LZ84Bom6KUx4nsjuPkvZ_Pzb_W9znd8nih_k_s-XjfISo, the big question, much like the recent post-VMware price rises, I think there is a fork in the road. Either we continue to stick with Terraform, as IBM no doubt attempts some renewed monetisation effort to make good on their investment, or we change our IaC tool. With the latter, what are our alternatives?Well, let\\u2019s start with the obvious: OpenTofu. This is perhaps the easiest short-term \\u2018fix\\u2019 for those not running cutting-edge Terraform, where they can use a compatible binary based on an earlier version.Pulumi is another potential option, though I would have financial sustainability concerns for their business model which is similar to Hashicorp\\u2019s old model.Crossplane is another option that generates quite a lot of noise with a Kubernetes-centric view of the world. I previously blogged a little about this approach in the context of Google\\u2019s Config Connector, showing some merit. Crossplane uses a similar \\u2018provider-centric\\u2019 approach like Terraform allowing easier extensibility to different platforms. Whilst the project is CNCF-backed (and going through adoption at the time of writing) the main contributor appears to be Upbound whose financial sustainability I am equally unsure of.Another option is to \\u2018go native,\\u2019 with each of the big three hyperscalers offering its dedicated options: Cloud Formation with AWS, Bicep with Azure, and Config Controller in Google Cloud. The main downside I see with this approach is fragmentation. Part of the appeal of Terraform was its consistency in configuration language, with providers abstracting the vendor-specific API calls.There are no doubt many other tools I have failed to mention, and please comment on any additional suggestions you have.What do I think?Source: https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/15173534/gettyimages-611975304.jpgI believe an \\u2018Open Terraform\\u2019 supported in development by those who profit from it is the answer. This is sort of what\\u2019s happened with OpenTofu, which has backers such as Gruntwork. I would love to see an expansion of this support base to include all the major hyperscalers, who, in practice, are the ones making the most money from Terraform. Many of these hyperscalers are already deeply involved in developing providers that interface Terraform with their platform. Expanding this toward the tool itself doesn\\u2019t seem like a big leap; if they decide to do this, though, is anyone\\u2019s guess, especially with the news so fresh, we will have to wait and see\\u2026Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.FreeDistraction-free reading.

You get a feel for what\\'s \\\\\"normal\\\\\" and for what\\'s unusual, and there are quite a few degrees of the latter. Take compounds of bromine, for example. Most any working chemist will immediately recognize bromine (there are exceptions) because we don\\'t commonly encounter too many opaque red liquids with a fog of corrosive orange fumes above them in the container. Which is good. That\\'s bromine in oxidation state zero, elemental, and then you have bromide (oxidation state -1), one of the most common anions around. \\\\\"Chlorides are rabble\\\\\", said Primo Levi in one of my favorite lines from The Periodic Table, and he was right about that, but bromides are not of much higher social standing. Every cation has a bromide salt, and it\\'s usually one of the cheaper ones in the catalog.So far, so good. But bromine can also go up to +3 and +5 oxidation states, and there things start to get interesting. You can have various mixed-halogen things, all of which are reactive and toxic and are distinguished by their various degrees of vileness. And you can get all sorts of bromine-oxygen species, ranging from the pretty well-known ones like bromate ion (BrO3-) all the way up to. . .well, to the stuff described in this new paper., from Konrad Seppelt at the Freie Universit\\\\u00e4t Berlin. It contains a whole list of new compounds that send my chemical intuition completely off the rails.I have no \\\\\"feel\\\\\" for them whatsoever except a strong desire never to prepare any of them. Prepare any of them? I don\\'t even want to make the starting material. You know you\\'re in for a bumpy ride when your work needs something like bromine fluorine dioxide (bromyl fluoride, BrO2F); no one can claim that they weren\\'t warned. There hasn\\'t even been a reliable synthesis of that stuff until now - Seppelt describes a new one, from the aforementioned sodium bromate, which is fine, and bromine pentafluoride, which is not fine, because it\\'s a hideous oxidizing and fluorinating agent fit to fluorinate you right into the afterlife and whose attempted use in liquid rocket propellent mixtures was abandoned because it was too foul to work with, and, oh yeah, redistilled pure hydrogen fluoride, which is also about as far from \\\\\"fine\\\\\" as you can get. The SI of the paper casually mentions that you can use double vacuum distillation in a metal line to get your HF sufficiently anhydrous for the reaction, and you can go ahead and get cranking on that without waiting for me to show up.You condense the latter two reagents onto a solid charge of the bromate at liquid nitrogen temperatures, and then let it warm all the way up to -78C, at which point a \\\\\"vigorous\\\\\" reaction sets in. Imagine running these things for the first time, waiting for said reaction and wondering if it\\'s going to stay inside your apparatus or invigorate itself all over the ceiling. Once you have made your bromyl fluoride, you raise the temperature a bit more to -40 and pump off the excess HF and pentafluoride, and you will want an extremely capable trap on the other end of that process, which according to the paper can take several hours, and probably had better. Finally, you sublime off the product from the solid residue in the tropical warmth of -10 or so and seal off that part of the tube.You have now prepared the colorless solid bromine fluorine dioxide. What to do with it? Well, what you don\\'t do is let it warm up too far past +10C, because it\\'s almost certainly going to explode. Keep that phrase in mind, it\\'s going to come in handy in this sort of work. Prof. Seppelt, as the first person with a reliable supply of the pure stuff, set forth to react it with a whole list of things and has produced a whole string of weird compounds with brow-furrowing crystal structures. I don\\'t even know what to call these beasts: how, for example, do you refer to the cation in Br3O6+ triflate? What\\'s the name for the compound shown at right? Very few of us will have the need to name it, though - you make that one by condensing trifluoroacetic anhydride onto the bromyl fluoride at -196C, then warming and recrystallizing the solid from liquified freon to give yellow crystals. Those melt at -12C, and according to the paper and its SI, \\\\\"The molten red liquid starts to gas slowly\\\\\" and \\\\\"inevitably explodes upon further warming\\\\\". Further experimentation runs a risk of exposure to further inevitabilities, and I\\'m glad that Prof. Seppelt\\'s expertise in the lab got him through all this.The SI strongly warns readers that the preparations therein must not under any circumstances be scaled up, and that is clearly the advice of someone who has has your best interests at heart. Even at the amounts described, you will want an excellent and well-maintained vacuum line, access to noncommon nonhousehold reagents like the aforementioned bromine pentafluoride, a willingness to do things like redistill anhydrous HF, and you will at all times want to be suited up like you\\'re going to going to spay a velociraptor. Ah, the halogen chemist\\'s life for me, me hearties, yo-ho-ho and a barrel of. . .well, we still don\\'t know what to name it.

In other words, let\\\\u2019s say the L1 cache is 32K, the L2 cache is 256K, and the L3 cache is 2M, why not have a single 32K + 256K + 2M L1 cache?\\\\nThe short version is that the various cache levels have very large variations in how they are designed; they are subject to different constraints and fulfill different purposes. As a rule of thumb, as you climb up the levels of the cache hierarchy, the caches get larger, slower, higher density (more bits stored per unit area), consume less power per bit stored, and gain additional tasks.\\\\nIn the hopes of building some intuition here, let\\\\u2019s start with an elaborate and somewhat quaint analogy. That\\\\u2019s right, it is\\\\u2026\\\\nCache story time!\\\\nSuppose you\\\\u2019re a white-collar office worker in some unnamed sprawling 1960s bureaucracy, with no computers in sight, and your job involves a lot of looking at and cross-referencing case files (here being folders containing sheets of paper).\\\\nYou have a desk (the L1 data cache). On your desk are the files (cache lines) you\\\\u2019re working on right now, and some other files you recently pulled and are either done with or expect to be looking at again. Working with a file generally means looking at the individual pages it contains (corresponding to bytes in a cache line). But unless they\\\\u2019re on your desk, files are just treated as a unit. You always grab whole files at a time, even if there\\\\u2019s only one page in them that you actually care about right now.\\\\nAlso in the office is a filing cabinet (L2 cache). That cabinet contains files you\\\\u2019ve handled recently, but aren\\\\u2019t using right now. When you\\\\u2019re done with what\\\\u2019s on your desk, most of these files will go back into that filing cabinet. Grabbing something from the cabinet isn\\\\u2019t immediate \\\\u2013 you need to walk up there, open the right drawer and thumb through a few index cards to find the right file \\\\u2013 but it\\\\u2019s still pretty quick.\\\\nSometimes other people need to look at a file that\\\\u2019s in your cabinet. There\\\\u2019s a guy with a cart, Buster (representing a sort of ring bus) who just keeps doing his rounds through all the offices. When an office worker needs a file they don\\\\u2019t have in their private cabinet, they just write a small request slip and hand it to Buster. For simplicity\\\\u2019s sake, let\\\\u2019s just say Buster knows where everything is. So the next time he comes by your office, Buster will check if someone requested any files that are in your cabinet, and if so will just silently pull these files out of the cabinet and put them on his cart. The next time he comes by the office of whoever requested the file, he\\\\u2019ll drop the file in their cabinet, and leave a receipt on the desk.\\\\nEvery once in a while, Buster notices a requested file isn\\\\u2019t in the cabinet, but on the desk instead. In that case, he can\\\\u2019t just silently grab it; he needs to ask the worker at the desk whether they\\\\u2019re done with it, and if no, that worker and the one who put in the request need to agree on what to do. There are tediously elaborate corporate protocols on what to do in that situation (meetings will be called for sure!).\\\\nThe filing cabinets are usually full. That means Buster can\\\\u2019t just put a new file in; he has to make space first, which he does by grabbing another file, preferably one that hasn\\\\u2019t been used in a while. Those files, Buster takes to the archive in the basement (L3 cache). In the basement, groups of files are kept densely packed in cardboard boxes on industrial shelving units. The regular office workers don\\\\u2019t get to come down here at all; it\\\\u2019s well out of their way and they\\\\u2019re not familiar with the details of the filing system. We leave that to the archival clerks.\\\\nWhenever Buster gets down here, he drops all the old files he grabbed for archival in the \\\\u201cin\\\\u201d tray at the front desk. He also drops off all the request slips for files that aren\\\\u2019t in any of the filing cabinets upstairs, but he doesn\\\\u2019t wait around until the clerks bring the files back, since it takes a while. They\\\\u2019re just going to take the request slips, pick up the file in question, and drop it off in the \\\\u201cout\\\\u201d tray whenever they\\\\u2019re done. So every time Buster comes around, he grabs whatever is in the \\\\u201cout\\\\u201d tray, puts it on his cart and takes it to the recipient when he next comes by.\\\\nNow, the problem is, there\\\\u2019s a lot of these files, and even with the efficient packing, they\\\\u2019re not even close to fitting in the basement. Most of the files are kept off-site; this is an office building in a nice part of town, and rents over here are way too high to spend that much space on storage. Instead, the company rents warehouse space 30 minutes out of town, where most of the old files are kept (this corresponds to DRAM). At the front desk of the basement sits Megan, the Head Archivist. Megan keeps track of which files are kept in the basement, and which are warehoused. So when Buster drops his request slips in the \\\\u201cin\\\\u201d tray, she checks which of them correspond to files in the basement (to be handled by the archival clerks) and which aren\\\\u2019t on-site. The latter just get added to a big pile of requests. Maybe once or twice a day, they send a van to the warehouse to grab the requested files, along with a corresponding number of old files to be mothballed (as said, the basement is full; they need to make space before they can store any more files from the warehouse).\\\\nBuster doesn\\\\u2019t know or care about the details of the whole warehousing operation; that\\\\u2019s Megan\\\\u2019s job. All he knows is that usually, those request slips he hands to the archive are handled pretty quickly, but sometimes they take hours.\\\\nBack to the original question\\\\nSo, what\\\\u2019s the point of this whole elaborate exercise? Briefly, to establish a more concrete model than an opaque \\\\u201cmagic cache\\\\u201d that allows us to think more clearly about the logistics involved. The logistics are just as important in designing a chip as they are in running an efficient office.\\\\nThe original question was \\\\u201cwhy don\\\\u2019t we build a single large cache, instead of several small ones\\\\u201d. So if you have say a quad-core machine with 4 cores that each have 32KB L1 data cache, 256KB L2 cache, plus 2MB of shared L3 cache, why don\\\\u2019t we just have a ~3MB shared cache to begin with?\\\\nIn our analogy: for pretty much the same reason we have individual office desks that are maybe 1.50m wide, instead of seating four different people at a single enormous desk that is 150m wide.\\\\nThe point of having something on the desk is that it\\\\u2019s within easy reach. If we make the desk too big, we defeat that purpose: if we need to walk 50m to get the file we want, the fact that it\\\\u2019s technically \\\\u201cright here on our desk\\\\u201d isn\\\\u2019t really helping. The same goes for L1 caches! Making them bigger makes them (physically) larger. Among other things, this makes accessing them slower and consume more energy (for various reasons). L1 caches are sized so they\\\\u2019re large enough to be useful, but small enough so they\\\\u2019re still fast to access.\\\\nA second point is that L1 caches deal with different types of accesses than other levels in the cache hierarchy. First off, there\\\\u2019s several of them: there\\\\u2019s the L1 data cache, but there\\\\u2019s also a L1 instruction cache, and e.g. Intel Core CPUs also have another instruction cache, the uOp cache, which is (depending on your point of view) either a parallel L1 instruction cache or a \\\\u201cL0 instruction cache\\\\u201d. \\\\nL1 data caches gets asked to read and write individual items that are most commonly between 1 and 8 bytes in size, somewhat more rarely larger (for SIMD instructions). Cache levels higher up in the hierarchy don\\\\u2019t generally bother with individual bytes. In our office analogy, everything that\\\\u2019s not on a desk somewhere is just handled at the granularity of individual files (or larger), corresponding to cache lines. The same is true in memory subsystems. When a core is performing a memory access, you deal in individual bytes; the higher-level caches generally handle data wholesale, one cache line at a time.\\\\nL1 instruction caches have quite different access patterns than data caches do, and unlike the L1 data cache, they\\\\u2019re read-only as far as the core is concerned. (Writing into the instruction cache generally happens indirectly, by putting the data in one of the higher-level unified caches, and then having the instruction cache reload their data from there). For these (and other) reasons, instruction caches are generally built quite differently from data caches; using a single unified L1 cache means that the resulting design needs to meet several conflicting design criteria, forcing compromises that make it worse at either purpose. A unified L1 cache also needs to handle both the instruction and data traffic, which is quite the load!\\\\nAs an aside: as a programmer, it\\\\u2019s easy to ignore how much cache bandwidth is needed to fetch instructions, but it\\\\u2019s quite a lot. For example, when not running code from the uOp cache, all Intel Core i7 CPU cores can fetch 16 bytes worth of instructions from the L1 instruction cache, every cycle, and will in fact keep doing so as long as instruction execution is keeping up with decoding. At 3GHz, we\\\\u2019re talking on the order of 50GB/s per core here, just for instruction fetches \\\\u2013 though, granted, only if the instruction fetch unit is busy all the time, instead of being stalled for some reason or other. In practice, the L2 cache usually only sees a small fraction of this, because L1 instruction caches work quite well. But if you\\\\u2019re designing a unified L1 cache, you need to anticipate at least bursts of both high instruction and high data traffic (think something like a fast memcpy of a few kilobytes of data with both source and destination in the L1 data caches).\\\\nThis is a general point, by the way. CPU cores can handle many memory accesses per cycle, as long as they all hit within the L1 caches. For a \\\\u201cHaswell\\\\u201d or later Core i7 at 3GHz, we\\\\u2019re talking aggregate code+data L1 bandwidths well over 300GB/s per core if you have just the right instruction mix; very unlikely in practice, but you still get bursts of very hot activity sometimes.\\\\nL1 caches are designed to be as fast as possible to handle these bursts of activity when they occur. Only what misses L1 needs to be passed on to higher cache levels, which don\\\\u2019t need to be nearly as fast, nor have as much bandwidth. They can worry more about power efficiency and density instead.\\\\nThird point: sharing. A big part of the point of having individual desks in the office analogy, or per-core L1 caches, is that they\\\\u2019re private. If it\\\\u2019s on your private desk, you don\\\\u2019t need to ask anyone; you can just grab it.\\\\nThis is crucial. In the office analogy, if you were sharing a giant desk with 4 people, you can\\\\u2019t just grab a file. That\\\\u2019s not just your desk, and one of your other 3 co-workers might need that file right now (maybe they\\\\u2019re trying to cross-reference it with another file they just picked up at the other end of the desk!). Every single time you want to pick up something, you need to yell out \\\\u201ceveryone OK if I grab this?\\\\u201d, and if someone else wanted it first, you have to wait. Or you can have some scheme where everyone needs to grab a ticket and wait in line until it\\\\u2019s their turn if there\\\\u2019s a conflict. Or something else; the details don\\\\u2019t matter much here, but anything you do requires coordination with others. \\\\nThe same thing applies with multiple cores sharing a cache. You can\\\\u2019t just start stomping over data unannounced; anything you do in a shared cache needs to be coordinated with all the others you\\\\u2019re sharing it with.\\\\nThat\\\\u2019s why we have private L1 caches. The L1 cache is your \\\\u201cdesk\\\\u201d. While you\\\\u2019re sitting there, you can just go ahead and work. The L2 cache (\\\\u201cfiling cabinet\\\\u201d) handles most of the coordination with others. Most of the time, the worker (the CPU core) is sitting at the desk. Buster can just come by, pick up a list of new requests, and put previously requested files into the filing cabinet without interrupting the worker at all.\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s only when the worker and Buster want to access the filing cabinet at the same time, or when someone else has requested a file that\\\\u2019s lying on the worker\\\\u2019s desk, that they need to stop and talk to each other.\\\\nIn short, the L1 cache\\\\u2019s job is to serve its CPU core first and foremost. Because it\\\\u2019s private, it requires very little coordination. The L2 cache is still private to the CPU core, but along with just caching, it has an extra responsibility: deal with most bus traffic and communication instead of interrupting the core (which has better things to do).\\\\nThe L3 cache is a shared resource, and access to it does need to be coordinated globally. In the office analogy, this worked by the workers only having a single way to access it: namely, by going through Buster (the bus). The bus is a choke point; the hope is that the preceding two cache levels have winnowed down the number of memory accesses far enough that this doesn\\\\u2019t end up being a performance bottleneck.\\\\nCaveats\\\\nThis article covers one particular cache topology that is matches current desktop (and notebook) x86 CPUs: per-core split L1I/L1D caches, per-core unified L2 cache, shared unified L3 cache, with the cores connected via a ring bus.\\\\nNot every system looks like this. Some (primarily older) systems don\\\\u2019t have split instruction and data caches; some have full Harvard architectures that treat instruction and data memory as completely separate all the way through. Often L2s are shared between multiple cores (think one office with one filing cabinet and multiple desks). In this type of configuration, the L2 caches effectively act as part of the bus between cores. Many systems don\\\\u2019t have L3 caches, and some have both L3 and L4 caches! I also didn\\\\u2019t talk about systems with multiple CPU sockets etc.\\\\nI stuck with a ring bus because it fits in nicely with the analogy. Ring buses are reasonably common. Sometimes (especially when only two or three blocks need to be connected) it\\\\u2019s a full mesh; sometimes it is multiple ring buses connected with a crossbar (which maps reasonably to the office analogy: a multi-story office building with one \\\\u201cBuster\\\\u201d making his rounds per floor, and an elevator connecting the floors).\\\\nAs a software developer, there\\\\u2019s a natural tendency to assume that you can magically connect module A to module B and the data just teleports from one end to the other. The way memory actually works is incredibly complicated by now, but the abstraction presented to the programmer is just one of a large, flat array of bytes.\\\\nHardware doesn\\\\u2019t work like that. Pieces aren\\\\u2019t magically connected through an invisible ether. Modules A and B aren\\\\u2019t abstract concepts; they\\\\u2019re physical devices, actual tiny machines, that take up actual physical area on a silicon die. Chips have a \\\\u201cfloor plan\\\\u201d, and that\\\\u2019s not a vague nod or an in-joke; it\\\\u2019s an actual 2D map of what goes where. If you want to connect A to B, you need to run an actual, physical wire between them. Wires take up space, and driving them takes power (more the longer they are). Running a bunch of wires between A and B means it\\\\u2019s physically blocking area that could be used to connect other things (yes, chips use wires on multiple layers, but it\\\\u2019s still a serious problem; google \\\\u201crouting congestion\\\\u201d if you\\\\u2019re interested). Moving data around on a chip is an actual logistical problem, and a fiendishly complicated one at that.\\\\nSo while the office thing is tongue-in-cheek, \\\\u201cwho needs to talk to whom\\\\u201d and \\\\u201chow does the geometry of this system look \\\\u2013 does it admit a sensible layout?\\\\u201d are very relevant questions for both hardware and overall system design that can have a huge impact. Spatial metaphors are a useful way of conceptualizing the underlying reality.\\\\nShare this:FacebookXLike Loading...\\\\n\\\\nRelated\\\\nCache coherency primerJuly 7, 2014In \\\\\"Coding\\\\\"Notes on caches and\\\\u00a0threadsFebruary 26, 2011In \\\\\"Coding\\\\\"Atomic operations and\\\\u00a0contentionAugust 18, 2014In \\\\\"Coding\\\\\" \\\\n\\\\nFrom \\\\u2192 Computer Architecture\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n26 Comments\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tdecourse permalink\\\\n\\\\nAnother thing about the L1 cache is that it\\\\u2019s not the only cache which is consulted on every memory access: there is also the TLB.

I can\\\\u2019t think of an obvious way to fit TLBs into the office analogy.\\\\nModern memory systems are often designed such that the TLB and L1 cache can be searched at the same time, with a final tag check to ensure that both the TLB and the L1 cache \\\\u201chit\\\\u201d.

Thanks!\\\\nI wonder how much of that knowledge is still needed for developers?\\\\nOf course, it depends on the programming level you work with. If you use really low-level language: like C (C++) (not to mention asm), then it might be worthy to understand the mechanics. But even then compilers do a great job of optimizing things (C++). And if you use languages like Jave or .NET then you might even don\\\\u2019t have a chance to access such low-level stuff.\\\\n\\\\nReply \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nfgiesen permalink\\\\n\\\\nMemory is one of the fundamental abstractions in computing, and the details of how it\\\\u2019s implemented \\\\u201cunder the hood\\\\u201d have major implications everywhere. In any language that compiles to machine code (be it ahead-of-time compiled C or even just-in-time compiled JavaScript!), cache-friendly data structures and algorithms frequently make a difference of an order of magnitude or more. (The difference is less pronounced with bytecode interpreters or similar, since the base overhead is larger.)\\\\nFor the most part, compilers can\\\\u2019t help you with this. In some fairly restricted cases (mostly dealing with very regular computations on large multidimensional arrays of numbers), some compilers can apply optimizations such as loop tiling that drastically affect cache behavior. Computations that fit the bill are few and far between in most programs.\\\\nFor the most part, it\\\\u2019s about choosing the right data structures and algorithms. Some languages really are high-level enough that the programmer only specifies the desired result and the exact implementation is up to the compiler (database query languages such as SQL or Datalog are an example), and such optimizations are possible. But the languages you mention (C++, Java, .NET languages such as C#) are not in that category. If you use a java.util.LinkedList in your classes\\\\u2019 interface, the compiler is not allowed to replace that with a java.util.ArrayList no matter how much it might want to. In .NET, there\\\\u2019s a distinction between reference and value types; they have different semantics, and they are also quite different in terms of memory access (reference types are always indirected through a pointer; value types are stored inline in their containing scope). Many of these are not things a compiler is allowed to change in your program; as a a general rule, most compilers have a lot of freedom about what they\\\\u2019re allowed to do inside a function (especially after inlining it into one of its callers), and are much more constrained when externally visible aspects such as method signatures or data types are concerned.\\\\n\\\\nReply \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tBartek F. permalink\\\\n\\\\nThanks for the reply. Good points.\\\\nEven if you don\\\\u2019t unerstand how L1 works, you have to get a basic understanding of how memory works. And in that case data structures that are cache friendly (continous order in memory, local) wil lbe much better that just pointer to nodes scattered around the memory space.\\\\nSo, in general I think every programmer shoulw try to understand what CPU cache does, but I worry that too many people won\\\\u2019t care and just rely on compiler/tools.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNeeraj Shukla permalink\\\\n\\\\nI intend to keep this in my L1 cache for sometime so that my brain can process, and totally understand it.\\\\nThis is very well explained.\\\\n\\\\nReply \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSumit Khanna permalink\\\\n\\\\nWow, this is an incredible post; takes me back to grad school and architecture class! I especially like the analogy where you talk about the desks being private. I also never thought about how instruction caches and data caches are separate (at least in the x86/64 world), which makes a lot of sense.\\\\nSo much of what we do as engineers is built on layers and layers of abstraction. There\\\\u2019s a photo (which I can\\\\u2019t find at the moment) of dune buggy tied to a flatbed truck which is sitting inside of a small box truck which is inside a semi-truck. It\\\\u2019s a perfect example of encapsulation. We depend on all those layers to work together, but most people don\\\\u2019t have a good understanding of what\\\\u2019s really going on.\\\\nAt least in the network/services world, we throw around the term \\\\u201cfull-stack\\\\u201d today for people who can at least setup the stuff they work on from start to finish (and if you can automate it, you get into the \\\\u201cdev-ops\\\\u201d world as well). Where security problems are found are where we find breaks between these layers of encapsulation. \\\\nEven for developers who may never touch machine architecture, analogies like this really help to build a high level understanding of very complex systems.\\\\nWhen we find edge cases that allow us to break those contracts between layers, we can find exploits. If we can break one of those straps; say the one holding flatbed to the box truck, all the other layers of straps and safety can break, causing the entire thing to come falling out the back.\\\\n\\\\nReply \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nfgiesen permalink\\\\n\\\\nSeparate instruction and data caches (along with first-level instruction/data TLBs when paging is supported) are common everywhere, not just on x86. Common ARMs, POWERs/PowerPCs, MIPSs, SPARCs etc. do the same thing.\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s a very natural subdivision in any pipelined processor, because instruction fetches have to happen every single cycle (as long as the core isn\\\\u2019t stalled), they generally have a different working set from data, and they happen many pipeline stages earlier than data cache accesses do.

You can buy cores with anything between 0 (e.g. ARM Cortex-M0) and 4 (e.g. Intel Broadwell-C) numbered levels of cache these days, and a case can be made that the uOp cache in Broadwell-C effectively acts as \\\\u201cL0 instruction cache\\\\u201d, bringing the number of cache levels up to 5. :)\\\\nDon\\\\u2019t get attached to any particular detail too much. The example chosen is nice in that having 3 cache levels allows me to show different organizations (private L2 connected to a shared bus, shared L3) for the higher cache levels. The interesting point here is not so much the particular decisions themselves, but what underlying trade-offs drive them: the most important one definitely is that you want private L1 caches so your cores can (for the most part) proceed uninterrupted, with the higher cache levels handling most of the communication.

Thanks for the very illuminating answer. One reason I asked it was that I was under the (clearly incorrect) impression that accesses from one part of a CPU chip to another would take place at roughly the same speed. Is this actually true, but the requirements of a multicore cache coherency within a processor add enough overhead that it isn\\\\u2019t true in practice?\\\\nI also remember the days when some cache levels weren\\\\u2019t on the CPU chip at all \\\\u2013 they were on the motherboard. Accessing them was still faster than accessing RAM. Things are simpler now.\\\\n\\\\nReply \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nfgiesen permalink\\\\n\\\\nMaintaining cache coherency usually does not make things much slower at all. More precisely, the implementations of it you see in the real world don\\\\u2019t, because chip makers are willing to throw a considerable amount of clever engineering at the problem of making the average memory operation fast (even if that does make contented operations somewhat slower). The crucial point is that most memory accesses don\\\\u2019t experience contention. The fast paths don\\\\u2019t end up doing much more work than a regular cache in a single-processor system (with no other cores to worry about) would, and the slow paths are taking rarely, unless the core you\\\\u2019re running does bad things (like having all cores contend on the same lock), in which case performance will tank badly. :)\\\\nA big factor in the higher cache levels being slower is simply that they\\\\u2019re larger, farther away, and reaching them usually requires passing through a few stages of buffering.\\\\nModern CPUs are clocked fast enough, and the propagation speed of electrical signals in them is slow enough \\\\u2013 which is to say, a small enough fraction of the speed of light :) \\\\u2013 that you can\\\\u2019t round-trip a signal from one corner of the chip to the opposite end within a single clock cycle. For the outermost wire layers, you apparently get about 1/4 c. At 4GHz for a high end desktop CPU, your cycle time is 0.25ns. At that speed, that means your signal can travel (on the fastest metal layers!) about 18.7mm within a single clock cycle. That\\\\u2019s one way. If you want a reply back, and assuming the recipient replies instantaneously (not realistic), you need to travel the same distance back \\\\u2013 so you get about 9.4mm.\\\\nNext, let\\\\u2019s consider the size of the chips in question. According to AnandTech, an Intel Skylake GT2 4C CPU die measures about 9mm\\\\u00d713.5mm (and that\\\\u2019s on the small end for a desktop chip, as they note). As you can see that\\\\u2019s too large to manage a round-trip in a single cycle. And that\\\\u2019s purely considering propagation delay; there are other factors too.\\\\nLarge caches take a while to access. Part of this is simply propagation delay from distance traveled \\\\u2013 some of it within the cache, some to get to the cache (and back). Another part is addressing the cache, e.g. taking the address bits and figuring out which row of the cache they correspond too. That\\\\u2019s a few logic ops per row (more for larger caches because there\\\\u2019s more address bits participating in that computation), and they add their part of the delay. Yet another factor is that caches often are in a different clock domain than at least some of the things they\\\\u2019re connected to, and cache accesses are generally not done directly; they go through a queue first, which both acts as a buffer for potential clock speed transitions and helps smooth over bursty access patterns. They also add extra delay, though.\\\\nAnother big one is that the caches really are built quite differently. For example, Intel likes to use so-called VIPT (virtually indexed, physically tagged) L1 data caches. Without going into too much detail, L1 data caches are usually N-way set associative, which means that for every address, there\\\\u2019s N possible locations in the cache where it can be stored. For the last few generations, Intel has used N=8 in their L1 caches. Now, each cache line stores both its contents and a \\\\u201ctag\\\\u201d, which stores the address for the cache line being kept there. These are usually physical memory addresses, not the virtual memory addresses user-mode programs commonly deal with. Now, virtual addresses have to be translated to physical addresses before a memory access can happen; there\\\\u2019s another type of cache, the TLB, that handles this bit (TLBs are by now built as multi-level caches as well). But first completing the translation, then performing the access would be slow. A VIPT cache computes the index (which determines which N possible locations to look at) from the virtual address, so the memory access can start before the corresponding physical address is even known.\\\\nFor the last few generations, Intel has had 8-way associative L1 data caches with 32KB size. The index is computed from the lower address bits \\\\u2013 32KB/8 = 4KB, the smallest supported page size on x86, which is the granularity of virtual memory remapping. Because the index is computed from the lower virtual address bits that don\\\\u2019t get remapped under the address translation, these lower address bits also match the corresponding physical address bits. The only problems is that we don\\\\u2019t yet know which of the 8 different potential locations the data we need is in \\\\u2013 so the cache \\\\u201csimply\\\\u201d fetches all 8! The rest of the address translation proceeds in parallel, and once the right physical address is known, the correct copy (of the 8 fetched), is sent outwards to the load/store unit. This kind of trickery shaves something like 1-2 cycles of precious latency off the L1 data access time. It\\\\u2019s worth it there, but nowhere else. By the time a L2 fetch happens (after a L1 miss), the physical address is known; and in a L2 (or later) access path, you\\\\u2019ll generally probe the tags first, to figure out which way (\\\\u201cways\\\\u201d are how the N possible locations for a given address are called) to access, and then only get that one copy of the data. Doing the tag lookup before rather than in parallel with the data lookup is slower but also a lot more power-efficient (among other things), and L2 (and higher) caches don\\\\u2019t need to squeeze every single cycle the way L1 caches do.\\\\nThere\\\\u2019s plenty more things like that. :)\\\\nNote that most of these are purely increases in latency; even when a signal takes a few cycles to reach the destination, that doesn\\\\u2019t mean you can\\\\u2019t change it every cycle if you want to; it just takes a while for the data to propagate from one end to the other.\\\\n\\\\nReply \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\\tThe 8th colored mage permalink\\\\n\\\\nHi ryg, it\\\\u2019s a little off topic, but is the Istruction cache has the same security mechanism as the L1 Data cache? i would have thought not necessarily, for the common use is that the code stays pretty much constant, but when i looked at the disassembly of FlushInstructionCache(otherProcess,\\\\u2026) i saw that all it does is return true. i am thinking it\\\\u2019s a legacy function from times or from a different arch where the instruction cache didn\\\\u2019t have those protections.\\\\nwell, i kinda care about it because writing a debugger has a lot of changing the code binary, and i don\\\\u2019t know if i should still call FlushInstructionCache or not?\\\\nthanks\\\\nThe 8th mage.\\\\n\\\\nReply \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nfgiesen permalink\\\\n\\\\nWhat do you mean by \\\\u201csecurity mechanism\\\\u201d here?

Eventually, they agreed, and under the guidance of lead engineer Walther Bauersfeld, Zeiss created something amazing.The use of models to show the movements of the planets and stars goes back centuries, starting with mechanical orreries that used clockwork mechanisms to depict our solar system. A modern upgrade was Clair Omar Musser\\\\u2019s desktop electric orrery, which he designed for the Seattle World\\\\u2019s Fair in 1962. The projector that Zeiss planned for the Deutsches Museum would be far more elaborate. For starters, there would be two planetariums. One would showcase the Copernican, or heliocentric, sky, displaying the stars and planets as they revolved around the sun. The other would show the Ptolemaic, or geocentric, sky, with the viewer fully immersed in the view, as if standing on the surface of the Earth, seemingly at the center of the universe. The task of realizing those ideas fell to Bauersfeld, a mechanical engineer by training and a managing director at Zeiss. Zeiss engineer Walther Bauersfeld worked out the electromechanical details of the planetarium. In this May 1920 entry from his lab notebook [right], he sketched the two-axis system for showing the daily and annual motions of the stars.ZEISS ArchiveAt first, Bauersfeld focused on projecting just the sun, moon, and planets of our solar system. At the suggestion of his boss, Rudolf Straubel, he added stars. World War I interrupted the work, but by 1920 Bauersfeld was back at it. One entry in May 1920 in Bauersfeld\\\\u2019s meticulous lab notebook showed the earliest depiction of the two-axis design that allowed for the display of the daily as well as the annual motions of the stars. (The notebook is preserved in the Zeiss Archive.)The planetarium projector was in fact a concatenation of many smaller projectors and a host of gears. According to the Zeiss Archive, a large sphere held all of the projectors for the fixed stars as well as a \\\\u201cplanet cage\\\\u201d that held projectors for the sun, the moon, and the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The fixed-star sphere was positioned so that it projected outward from the exact center of the dome. The planetarium also had projectors for the Milky Way and the names of major constellations. The projectors within the planet cage were organized in tiers with complex gearing that allowed a motorized drive to move them around one axis to simulate the annual rotations of these celestial objects against the backdrop of the stars. The entire projector could also rotate around a second axis, simulating the Earth\\\\u2019s polar axis, to show the rising and setting of the sun, moon, and planets over the horizon. The Zeiss planetarium projected onto a spherical surface, which consisted of a geodesic steel lattice overlaid with concrete.Zeiss ArchiveBauersfeld also contributed to the design of the surrounding projection dome, which achieved its exactly spherical surface by way of a geodesic network of steel rods covered by a thin layer of concrete. Planetariums catch on worldwideThe first demonstration of what became known as the Zeiss Model I projector took place on 21 October 1923 before the Deutsches Museum committee in their not-yet-completed building, in Munich. \\\\u201cThis planetarium is a marvel,\\\\u201d von Miller declared in an administrative report. In 1924, public demonstrations of the Zeiss planetarium took place on the roof of the company\\\\u2019s factory in Jena, Germany.ZEISS ArchiveThe projector then returned north to Jena for further adjustments and testing. The company also began offering demonstrations of the projector in a makeshift dome on the roof of its factory. From July to September 1924, more than 30,000 visitors experienced the Zeisshimmel (Zeiss sky) this way. These demonstrations became informal visitor-experience studies and allowed Zeiss and the museum to make refinements and improvements. On 7 May 1925, the world\\\\u2019s first projection planetarium officially opened to the public at the Deutsches Museum. The Zeiss Model I displayed 4,500 stars, the band of the Milky Way, the sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Gears and motors moved the projector to replicate the changes in the sky as Earth rotated on its axis and revolved around the sun. Visitors viewed this simulation of the night sky from the latitude of Munich and in the comfort of a climate-controlled building, although at first chairs were not provided. (I get a crick in the neck just thinking about it.) The projector was bolted to the floor, but later versions were mounted on rails to move them back and forth. A presenter operated the machine and lectured on astronomical topics, pointing out constellations and the orbits of the planets. Word of the Zeiss planetarium spread quickly, through postcards and images.ZEISS ArchiveThe planetarium\\\\u2019s influence quickly extended far beyond Germany, as museums and schools around the world incorporated the technology into immersive experiences for science education and public outreach. Each new planetarium was greeted with curiosity and excitement. Postcards and images of planetariums (both the distinctive domed buildings and the complicated machines) circulated widely. In 1926, Zeiss opened its own planetarium in Jena based on Bauersfeld\\\\u2019s specifications. The first city outside of Germany to acquire a Zeiss planetarium was Vienna. It opened in a temporary structure on 7 May 1927 and in a permanent structure four years later, only to be destroyed during World War II. The Zeiss planetarium in Rome, which opened in 1928, projected the stars onto the domed vault of the 3rd-century Aula Ottagona, part of the ancient Baths of Diocletian. The first planetarium in the western hemisphere opened in Chicago in May 1930. Philanthropist Max Adler, a former executive at Sears, contributed funds to the building that now bears his name. He called it a \\\\u201cclassroom under the heavens.\\\\u201d Japan\\\\u2019s first planetarium, a Zeiss Model II, opened in Osaka in 1937 at the Osaka City Electricity Science Museum. As its name suggests, the museum showcased exhibits on electricity, funded by the municipal power company. The city council had to be convinced of the educational value of the planetarium. But the mayor and other enthusiasts supported it. The planetarium operated for 50 years.Who doesn\\\\u2019t love a planetarium?After World War II and the division of Germany, the Zeiss company also split in two, with operations continuing at Oberkochen in the west and Jena in the east. Both branches continued to develop the planetarium through the Zeiss Model VI before shifting the nomenclature to more exotic names, such as the Spacemaster, Skymaster, and Cosmorama. The two large spheres of the Zeiss Model II, introduced in 1926, displayed the skies of the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. Each sphere contained a number of smaller projectors.ZEISS ArchiveOver the years, refinements included increased precision, the addition of more stars, automatic controls that allowed the programming of complete shows, and a shift to fiber optics and LED lighting. Zeiss still produces planetariums in a variety of configurations for different size domes.Today more than 4,000 planetariums are in operation globally. A planetarium is often the first place where children connect what they see in the night sky to a broader science and an understanding of the universe. My hometown of Richmond, Va., opened its first planetarium in April 1983 at the Science Museum of Virginia. That was a bit late in the big scheme of things, but just in time to wow me as a kid. I still remember the first show I saw, narrated by an animatronic Mark Twain with a focus on the 1986 visit of Halley\\\\u2019s Comet. By then the museum also had a giant OmniMax screen that let me soar over the Grand Canyon, watch beavers transform the landscape, and swim with whale sharks, all from the comfort of my reclining seat. No wonder the museum is where I got my start as a public historian of science and technology. I began volunteering there at age 14 and have never looked back.

Pulumi is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform that simplifies resource management across any cloud or SaaS provider, including Docker. Pulumi providers are integrations with useful tools and vendors. Pulumi\\\\u2019s new Docker Build provider is about making your builds even easier, faster, and more reliable.\\\\u00a0 In this post, we will dive into how Pulumi\\\\u2019s new Docker Build provider works with Docker Build Cloud to streamline building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. First, we\\\\u2019ll set up a project using Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi. Then, we\\\\u2019ll explore cool use cases that showcase how you can leverage this provider to simplify your build and deployment pipelines. \\\\u00a0  Pulumi Docker Build provider features Top features of the Pulumi Docker Build provider include the following:  Docker Build Cloud support: Offload your builds to the cloud and free up your local resources. Faster builds mean fewer headaches. Multi-platform support: Build Docker images that work on different hardware architectures without breaking a sweat. Advanced caching: Say goodbye to redundant builds. In addition to the shared caching available when you use Docker Build Cloud, this provider supports multiple cache backends, like Amazon S3, GitHub Actions, and even local disk, to keep your builds efficient. Flexible export options: Customize where your Docker images go after they\\\\u2019re built \\\\u2014 export to registries, filesystems, or wherever your workflow needs.  Getting started with Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 Docker Build Cloud is Docker\\\\u2019s newest offering that provides a pair of AMD and Arm builders in the cloud and shared cache for your team, resulting in up to 39x faster image builds. Docker Personal, Pro, Team, and Business plans include a set number of Build Cloud minutes, or you can purchase a Build Cloud Team plan to add minutes. Learn more about Docker Build Cloud plans.\\\\u00a0 The example builds an NGINX Dockerfile using a Docker Build Cloud builder. We will create a Docker Build Cloud builder, create a Pulumi program in Typescript, and build our image. Prerequisites  Docker Pulumi CLI Pulumi Cloud account (Individual free tier works) A Pulumi-supported language Docker Build Cloud Team plan or a Docker Core Subscription with available Docker Build Cloud minutes  Step 1: Set up your Docker Build Cloud builder Building images locally means being subject to local compute and storage availability. Pulumi allows users to build images with Docker Build Cloud. The Pulumi Docker Build provider fully supports Docker Build Cloud, which unlocks new capabilities, as individual team members or a CI/CD pipeline can fully take advantage of improved build speeds, shared build cache, and native multi-platform builds. If you still need to create a builder, follow the steps below; otherwise, skip to step 1C. A. Log in to your Docker Build Cloud account. B. Create a new cloud builder named my-cool-builder.\\\\u00a0 Figure 1: Create the new cloud builder and call it my-cool-builder. C. In your local machine, sign in to your Docker account. $ docker login D. Add your existing cloud builder endpoint. $ docker buildx create --driver cloud ORG/BUILDER_NAME\\\\n# Replace ORG with the Docker Hub namespace of your Docker organization. \\\\n# This creates a builder named cloud-ORG-BUILDER_NAME.\\\\n\\\\n# Example:\\\\n$ docker buildx create --driver cloud pulumi/my-cool-builder\\\\n# cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder\\\\n\\\\n# check your new builder is configured\\\\n$ docker buildx ls\\\\n E. Optionally, see that your new builder is available in Docker Desktop. Figure 2: The Builders view in the Docker Desktop settings lists all available local and Docker Build Cloud builders available to the logged-in account. For additional guidance on setting up Docker Build Cloud, refer to the Docker docs. Step 2: Set up your Pulumi project To create your first Pulumi project, start with a Pulumi template. Pulumi has curated hundreds of templates that are directly integrated with the Pulumi CLI via pulumi new. In particular, the Pulumi team has created a Pulumi template for Docker Build Cloud to get you started. The Pulumi programming model centers around defining infrastructure using popular programming languages. This approach allows you to leverage existing programming tools and define cloud resources using familiar syntaxes such as loops and conditionals. To copy the Pulumi template locally: $ pulumi new https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/dockerbuildcloud-ts --dir hello-dbc\\\\n# project name: hello-dbc \\\\n# project description: (default)\\\\n# stack name: dev\\\\n# Note: Update the builder value to match yours\\\\n# builder: cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder \\\\n$ cd hello-dbc\\\\n\\\\n# update all npm packages (recommended)\\\\n$ npm update --save\\\\n Optionally, explore your Pulumi program. The hello-dbc folder has everything you need to build a Dockerfile into an image with Pulumi. Your Pulumi program starts with an entry point, typically a function written in your chosen programming language. This function defines the infrastructure resources and configurations for your project. For TypeScript, that file is index.ts, and the contents are shown below: import * as dockerBuild from \\\\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\\\";\\\\nimport * as pulumi from \\\\\"@pulumi/pulumi\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nconst config = new pulumi.Config();\\\\nconst builder = config.require(\\\\\"builder\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n\\\\n   // Configures the name of your existing buildx builder to use.\\\\n   // See the Pulumi.<stack>.yaml project file for the builder configuration.\\\\n   builder: {\\\\n       name: builder, // Example, \\\\\"cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder\\\\\",\\\\n   },\\\\n   context: {\\\\n       location: \\\\\"app\\\\\",\\\\n   },\\\\n   // Enable exec to run a custom docker-buildx binary with support\\\\n   // for Docker Build Cloud (DBC).\\\\n   exec: true,\\\\n   push: false,\\\\n});\\\\n Step 3: Build your Docker image Run the pulumi up command to see the image being built with the newly configured builder: $ pulumi up --yes\\\\n You can follow the browser link to the Pulumi Cloud dashboard and navigate to the Image resource to confirm it\\\\u2019s properly configured by noting the builder parameter. Figure 3: Navigate to the Image resource to check the configuration. Optionally, also check your Docker Build Cloud dashboard for build minutes usage: Figure 4: The build.docker.com view shows the user has selected the Cloud builders from the left menu and the product dashboard is shown on the right side. Congratulations! You have built an NGINX Dockerfile with Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi. This was achieved by creating a new Docker Build Cloud builder and passing that to a Pulumi template. The Pulumi CLI is then used to deploy the changes. Advanced use cases with buildx and BuildKit To showcase popular buildx and BuildKit features, test one or more of the following Pulumi code samples. These include multi-platform, advanced caching,\\\\u00a0 and exports. Note that each feature is available as an input (or parameter) in the Pulumi Docker Build Image resource.\\\\u00a0 Multi-platform image builds for Docker Build Cloud Docker images can support multiple platforms, meaning a single image may contain variants for architectures and operating systems.\\\\u00a0 The following code snippet is analogous to invoking a build from the Docker CLI with the --platform flag to specify the target platform for the build output. import * as dockerBuild from \\\\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n   // Build a multi-platform image manifest for ARM and AMD.\\\\n   platforms: [\\\\n       dockerBuild.Platform.Linux_amd64,\\\\n       dockerBuild.Platform.Linux_arm64,\\\\n   ],\\\\n   push: false,\\\\n\\\\n});\\\\n Deploy the changes made to the Pulumi program: $ pulumi up --yes\\\\n Caching from and to AWS ECR Maintaining cached layers while building Docker images saves precious time by enabling faster builds. However, utilizing cached layers has been historically challenging in CI/CD pipelines due to recycled environments between builds. The cacheFrom and cacheTo parameters allow programmatic builds to optimize caching behavior.\\\\u00a0 Update your Docker image resource to take advantage of caching: import * as dockerBuild from \\\\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\\\";\\\\nimport * as pulumi from \\\\\"@pulumi/pulumi\\\\\";\\\\nimport * as aws from \\\\\"@pulumi/aws\\\\\"; // Required for ECR\\\\n\\\\n// Create an ECR repository for pushing.\\\\nconst ecrRepository = new aws.ecr.Repository(\\\\\"ecr-repository\\\\\", {});\\\\n\\\\n// Grab auth credentials for ECR.\\\\nconst authToken = aws.ecr.getAuthorizationTokenOutput({\\\\n   registryId: ecrRepository.registryId,\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n   push: true,\\\\n   // Use the pushed image as a cache source.\\\\n   cacheFrom: [{\\\\n       registry: {\\\\n           ref: pulumi.interpolate`${ecrRepository.repositoryUrl}:cache`,\\\\n       },\\\\n   }],\\\\n   cacheTo: [{\\\\n       registry: {\\\\n           imageManifest: true,\\\\n           ociMediaTypes: true,\\\\n           ref: pulumi.interpolate`${ecrRepository.repositoryUrl}:cache`,\\\\n       },\\\\n   }],\\\\n   // Provide our ECR credentials.\\\\n   registries: [{\\\\n       address: ecrRepository.repositoryUrl,\\\\n       password: authToken.password,\\\\n       username: authToken.userName,\\\\n   }],\\\\n})\\\\n Notice the declaration of additional resources for AWS ECR.\\\\u00a0 Export builds as a tar file Exporting allows us to share or back up the resulting image from a build invocation.\\\\u00a0 To export the build as a local .tar file, modify your resource to include the exports Input: const image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n   push: false,\\\\n   exports: [{\\\\n       docker: {\\\\n           tar: true,\\\\n       },\\\\n   }],\\\\n})\\\\n Deploy the changes made to the Pulumi program: $ pulumi up --yes\\\\n Review the Pulumi Docker Build provider guide to explore other Docker Build features, such as build arguments, build contexts, remote contexts, and more.

This happened with multiple searches and will probably get even worse as the time goes on.\\\\nExample\\\\nFor example search AWS Lightsail xray, brings up this AI Answer from Pulumi as the top result:\\\\n\\\\nLink to the AI Answer: https://www.pulumi.com/ai/answers/bLHAi4DutXJvbJyNngGRvS/optimizing-aws-lightsail-and-x-ray-deployment.\\\\nWhile this might seem like a good thing for someone, spamming high ranked results that are at best misleading and at worst destructive does not seem like something I would want to associate Pulumi as a brand. There\\'s already tons of generated, false content available on the internet and adding even more noise to the search results is not a good idea.\\\\nI would highly recommend Disallow:ing robots from scraping https://www.pulumi.com/ai/answers via Robots.txt or similar functionality.\\\\nAdditional context\\\\nAdding -inurl:[pulumi.com/ai] to your query will remove Pulumi AI answers from the search results, but it\\'s cumbersome.\\\\nContributing\\\\nVote on this issue by adding a \\\\ud83d\\\\udc4d reaction.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\\\\n            \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\ud83d\\\\udc4d\\\\n163\\\\n akx, joneteus, jhirvioja, anttispitkanen, happosade, ilmarivacklinsc, timiwahalahti, vvalkonen, mieky, HelloFillip, and 153 more reacted with thumbs up emoji\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nAll reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\udc4d\\\\n163 reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\npetetnt\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          added\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n  kind/bug\\\\n\\\\nSome behavior is incorrect or out of spec\\\\n\\\\n  needs-triage\\\\n\\\\nNeeds attention from the triage team\\\\n\\\\n  labels\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    Mar 21, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\n            Copy link\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAaronFriel\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n      commented\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        Mar 22, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          edited by cnunciato\\\\n          \\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHey @petetnt, we\\'ve taken this feedback from you and others and we\\'ve taken steps to remove more than half (almost two thirds) of AI Answers, and we plan to continue to ensure that these AI answers are complementary to our existing documentation.\\\\nWe are also taking steps to:\\\\n\\\\nEnsure our pages are grounded in the real APIs and upstream documentation\\\\nValidating the results, e.g.: via type checking and testing the generated code\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\ud83d\\\\udc4d\\\\n15\\\\n happosade, wolverian, mieky, joonakilpinen, shstkvch, XeroOl, dvaun, mikejk8s, lfuelling, drakmail, and 5 more reacted with thumbs up emoji\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nAll reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\udc4d\\\\n15 reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAaronFriel\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        removed\\\\n  the \\\\n\\\\n  needs-triage\\\\n\\\\nNeeds attention from the triage team\\\\n label\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    Mar 22, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAaronFriel\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        assigned     AaronFriel and     interurban\\\\nMar 22, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\n            Copy link\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ncnunciato\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n      commented\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        Mar 22, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nwe\\'ve taken steps to remove more than half of AI Answers\\\\n\\\\nWorth mentioning this list was submitted to Google this morning, so it could be a bit before they\\'re removed from search results.

In short: we\\'ve gotten very positive feedback users when the pages show up appropriately and don\\'t clutter the first page of results in a search engine. We don\\'t want to throw out the good with the bad, and we\\'ve marked those pages as noindex. The URL Inspection tool reports what we expect since setting these pages to 404:\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll speak to @tobytteh\\'s comment here, which I think captures the frustration folks have and the underlying question of why we Pulumi feels comfortable generating code examples with AI:\\\\n\\\\nThis use of AI is monstrously stupid. Let us all pray to our respective gods that someone at Pulumi is intelligent enough to end this.\\\\n\\\\nCode generation is Pulumi\\'s bread and butter, it is a core competency of our engineering org. Every one of our providers has a rich schema describing the SDK (example Docker provider schema.json). Those schemas are then used to generate the SDKs for each language (source code in github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pkg/codegen). Pulumi AI combines this with retrieval augmented generation and type checking of generated programs to be more than ten times more likely to generate valid, working code for many questions than ChatGPT (GPT-4) on its own. Generating ten times better code than state of the art language models is itself a feat, but we aren\\'t resting on our laurels and we\\'re continuing to work on setting an even higher bar for ourselves to ensure that every program we publish would work from copy-and-paste to pulumi up.\\\\nThat said, we certainly didn\\'t expect the result of publishing as many pages as we did, and that\\'s why we\\'ve taken drastic steps to withdraw a significant number (around 2/3) of the AI Answers. We\\'ll continue to raise the bar on quality and prune pages that do not meet our standards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nAll reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\n            Copy link\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAuthor\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\npetetnt\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n      commented\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        May 7, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          edited\\\\n          \\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPersonally I don\\\\u2019t think the (alledged) 2/3rds is nearly good enough ratio to spam the internet full of absolutely wrong answers.

These build upon and extend our rich Pulumi Deployments foundation for deployment orchestration and workflow. This is an exciting, customer-driven release, with new features that help with Day 2 operations and management.These new features are:Drift Detection and Remediation - Continuously detect and remediate driftTime-to-Live Stacks - Clean up stale infrastructure automaticallyScheduled Deployments - Automate recurring workflows on a scheduleFree Deployments Minutes - Use all of the above for free, no matter your tier!We built these features based on customer feedback, and our 2,500+ customers are excited:\\\\u201cAt Oleria, we understand the importance of addressing issues with privacy, security, and data integrity. Earning and maintaining our trust isn\\\\u2019t just a responsibility but a fundamental aspect of our mission,\\\\u201d said Jim Alkove, CEO of Oleria. \\\\u201cPulumi also understands how these attributes affect cloud infrastructure. Our team is excited to use these new capabilities, giving us even more confidence as we enable our customers to securely manage access to decentralized SaaS applications, adaptively and intelligently.\\\\u201dThese advanced features are available today in the Enterprise and Business Critical editions of Pulumi Cloud. These features together enable an end-to-end experience for managing the lifecycle and consistency of your cloud infrastructure to ensure enterprises have the capabilities needed to operate at scale.Infrastructure Lifecycle Management Capabilities - Excelling at Day 2 and BeyondSo, why infrastructure lifecycle management?Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is table stakes for our customers. It helps to ensure Day 1, 2, and beyond cloud practices are robust, secure, and dependable. However, operational realities mean that sometimes teams need more flexibility than what strict IaC and Git-driven deployments offer.For example, maybe you need to break glass and interact with the AWS console directly to open up SSH to an EC2 instance in order to debug a gnarly issue. Or maybe you need to scale up your Auto Scaling group (ASG) temporarily while a live-site incident of unexpected traffic peaks plays out. Or maybe someone added tags to your resource without knowing it was under the management of Pulumi. This can lead to drift, where your IaC configuration no longer matches reality, and reality no longer matches your IaC. This is where Drift Detection and Remediation comes in to automatically report on and reconcile it.Alternatively, you may want to enable self-service infrastructure provisioning for your entire team, including developers and data scientists, who are not infrastructure experts. But what if they forget to wind things down when they\\\\u2019re done? You are left spending valuable money and resources managing infrastructure that\\\\u2019s no longer needed. Time-to-Live Stacks automatically reclaim such ephemeral infrastructure, enabling self-serve with confidence.Next up, we often want to deploy on a Git commit, which Pulumi Deployments already handles. However, what if we want more flexibility around how and when deployments occur? For instance, perhaps you\\\\u2019re a retailer who doesn\\\\u2019t want to deploy on Black Friday. Or maybe you prefer to deploy at set times throughout the week rather than on every Git commit. This is where Scheduled Deployments comes in, to give us flexible cron-based scheduling of deployments.Finally, we want everyone to be able to kick the tires with all of the above, no commitments needed. That\\\\u2019s why we\\\\u2019re also announcing today that all users \\\\u2013 individuals, teams, and enterprises alike \\\\u2013 get an allotment of free monthly deployment minutes to use all of this.Get started now for free at app.pulumi.com. We can\\\\u2019t wait to hear what you think!Happy cloud spelunking.featuresinfrastructure-lifecycle-managementSubscribe to the Pulumi Monthly NewsletterEnter your email*Last UTM MediumLast UTM CampaignLast UTM SourceShare this post\\\\nGet StartedInstallDocumentationRegistryPublic RoadmapSecurityEnterpriseAWSAzureGoogle CloudContainersServerlessKubernetesAbout UsRequest a DemoTalk to a humanSupportCareersResourcesSlack ArchiveCase StudiesAwards & RecognitionsBrand ResourcesYour Website PreferencesSign up for our newsletterEnter your email*Last UTM MediumLast UTM CampaignLast UTM SourceTrademark UsageAcceptable Use PolicyTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyProfessional Services Agreement\\\\u00a9 Pulumi 2024We use cookies (and other similar technologies) to collect data to improve your experience on our site.

(Unless The Stack is sorely mistaken, \\\\\"Cloud Manager\\\\\" is a lick of Oracle paint on an underlying open source Terraform engine; or was... )Oracle\\\\u2019s OpenTofu shiftIn a short blog, an EBS product director at Oracle said that its \\\\u201clatest Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Cloud Manager update, 24.1.1.1, is now available,\\\\u201d urging customers to update \\\\u201cat your earliest convenience.\\\\u201d\\\\u201cIn this release, we have switched from Terraform to OpenTofu due to forthcoming Terraform licensing changes,\\\\u201d wrote Terri Noyes.\\\\u201c You must therefore upgrade your Cloud Manager to 24.1.1.1 by June 30, 2024 at the latest,\\\\u201d she said, adding that the release updated further components to \\\\u201cmaintain security standards and improve supportability.\\\\u201dThe move comes after Hashicorp\\\\u2019s 2023 decision to adopt a more restrictive BSL 1.1. Licence for Terraform and other products, instead of the MPL 2.0 that it previously used. That move triggered a swift fork, OpenTofu, adopted by the Linux Foundation. (Version 1.7 landed in March 2024 and was widely considered to be the first enterprise-ready version.)Oracle\\\\u2019s move seems like a straightforward decision to ensure it is using the most permissive underlying IaC tool without having to worry about downstream licence complications, no more and no less. OpenTofu is essentially a pretty familiar drop-in replacement for Terraform; using it here is ultimately a minor implementation detail for those looking to move complex EBS environments to the cloud, but it does signal that serious enterprises feel the fork is already robust enough to use.\\\\u00a0In late April IBM agreed to buy Hashicorp for $6.7 billion.\\\\u00a0See also: \\\\\"Red Hash\\\\\"?

When I first heard the rumours yesterday, I was concerned about the future of possibly my favourite Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool. It has long been obvious that Hashicorp has been struggling to make money, making a $274 million loss in 2023. This undoubtedly led to the highly controversial switch to the BSL license in August 2023 and the community fork of OpenTofu. Hashicorp is hardly alone in its struggles, with Redis adopting a similar approach, resulting in the Valkey fork or Elasticsearch with its license changes.The challenge of open-source monetisationFundamentally, many of these companies have struggled to sufficiently monetise the open-source tools they have developed, and this is where I want to bust a myth some people seem to have:There is no such thing as \\\\u2018free\\\\u2019 softwareSure, there is plenty of software that is free at the point of use and can be modified under permissive licenses and the like, but fundamentally, developers are spending time writing code, and time typically requires some payment.Source: https://accidentalastro.com/2022/12/will-code-for-food/I appreciate there are several hobby projects that people may contribute to in their spare time, but large open-source projects are typically supported by big tech firms contributing engineers or money to enable developers to work part or full-time on them; for example, look at the companies who pay to be members of the Linux foundation. As another example, Google is still the largest single contributor to the Kubernetes project. Google can do this because it makes money running services that rely on it, and sells a managed offering in Google Kubernetes Engine.Source: https://www.cncf.io/reports/kubernetes-project-journey-report/Hashicorp struggles with this, people have long used their free tool to orchestrate public and private cloud environments but had little reason to pay for the Terraform Cloud product even if it had some advantages.The problem with IBM buying HashicorpSource: https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2024/04/967925a7-hashicorp-ibm.jpgSo Hashicorp was a financial disaster even though they had good products, I have personally worked with Terraform & Packer and seen plenty of Vault implementations. A lot of companies liked Hashicorp tooling because it was inherently cloud-agnostic; for multi-cloud organisations, having a common configuration language in Terraform or a secret management solution in Vault was preferable to learning each in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or the multitude of other providers.This leads me to my first concern, IBM has a conflict of interest. IBM has a cloud offering, admittedly with a 1.8% market share. Why would they want to keep developing tools that frankly benefit their competitors more than them?My second concern, perhaps my biggest, is that IBM has a graveyard of failed acquisitions of good software companies. In recent history, their acquisition of Red Hat resulted in changes to CentOS that destroyed the market share of this once-popular distribution, anecdotally often in favour of Ubuntu LTS. This is far from the only example with Lotus Software being another from the 2000s. I simply have no trust in IBM to look after Hashicorp as a company.So, where do we go from here?Source: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQG7bJnXPlbrsw/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1520066260072?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=LZ84Bom6KUx4nsjuPkvZ_Pzb_W9znd8nih_k_s-XjfISo, the big question, much like the recent post-VMware price rises, I think there is a fork in the road. Either we continue to stick with Terraform, as IBM no doubt attempts some renewed monetisation effort to make good on their investment, or we change our IaC tool. With the latter, what are our alternatives?Well, let\\\\u2019s start with the obvious: OpenTofu. This is perhaps the easiest short-term \\\\u2018fix\\\\u2019 for those not running cutting-edge Terraform, where they can use a compatible binary based on an earlier version.Pulumi is another potential option, though I would have financial sustainability concerns for their business model which is similar to Hashicorp\\\\u2019s old model.Crossplane is another option that generates quite a lot of noise with a Kubernetes-centric view of the world. I previously blogged a little about this approach in the context of Google\\\\u2019s Config Connector, showing some merit. Crossplane uses a similar \\\\u2018provider-centric\\\\u2019 approach like Terraform allowing easier extensibility to different platforms. Whilst the project is CNCF-backed (and going through adoption at the time of writing) the main contributor appears to be Upbound whose financial sustainability I am equally unsure of.Another option is to \\\\u2018go native,\\\\u2019 with each of the big three hyperscalers offering its dedicated options: Cloud Formation with AWS, Bicep with Azure, and Config Controller in Google Cloud. The main downside I see with this approach is fragmentation. Part of the appeal of Terraform was its consistency in configuration language, with providers abstracting the vendor-specific API calls.There are no doubt many other tools I have failed to mention, and please comment on any additional suggestions you have.What do I think?Source: https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/15173534/gettyimages-611975304.jpgI believe an \\\\u2018Open Terraform\\\\u2019 supported in development by those who profit from it is the answer. This is sort of what\\\\u2019s happened with OpenTofu, which has backers such as Gruntwork. I would love to see an expansion of this support base to include all the major hyperscalers, who, in practice, are the ones making the most money from Terraform. Many of these hyperscalers are already deeply involved in developing providers that interface Terraform with their platform. Expanding this toward the tool itself doesn\\\\u2019t seem like a big leap; if they decide to do this, though, is anyone\\\\u2019s guess, especially with the news so fresh, we will have to wait and see\\\\u2026Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.FreeDistraction-free reading.

Pulumi is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform that simplifies resource management across any cloud or SaaS provider, including Docker. Pulumi providers are integrations with useful tools and vendors. Pulumi\\\\u2019s new Docker Build provider is about making your builds even easier, faster, and more reliable.\\\\u00a0 In this post, we will dive into how Pulumi\\\\u2019s new Docker Build provider works with Docker Build Cloud to streamline building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. First, we\\\\u2019ll set up a project using Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi. Then, we\\\\u2019ll explore cool use cases that showcase how you can leverage this provider to simplify your build and deployment pipelines. \\\\u00a0  Pulumi Docker Build provider features Top features of the Pulumi Docker Build provider include the following:  Docker Build Cloud support: Offload your builds to the cloud and free up your local resources. Faster builds mean fewer headaches. Multi-platform support: Build Docker images that work on different hardware architectures without breaking a sweat. Advanced caching: Say goodbye to redundant builds. In addition to the shared caching available when you use Docker Build Cloud, this provider supports multiple cache backends, like Amazon S3, GitHub Actions, and even local disk, to keep your builds efficient. Flexible export options: Customize where your Docker images go after they\\\\u2019re built \\\\u2014 export to registries, filesystems, or wherever your workflow needs.  Getting started with Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 Docker Build Cloud is Docker\\\\u2019s newest offering that provides a pair of AMD and Arm builders in the cloud and shared cache for your team, resulting in up to 39x faster image builds. Docker Personal, Pro, Team, and Business plans include a set number of Build Cloud minutes, or you can purchase a Build Cloud Team plan to add minutes. Learn more about Docker Build Cloud plans.\\\\u00a0 The example builds an NGINX Dockerfile using a Docker Build Cloud builder. We will create a Docker Build Cloud builder, create a Pulumi program in Typescript, and build our image. Prerequisites  Docker Pulumi CLI Pulumi Cloud account (Individual free tier works) A Pulumi-supported language Docker Build Cloud Team plan or a Docker Core Subscription with available Docker Build Cloud minutes  Step 1: Set up your Docker Build Cloud builder Building images locally means being subject to local compute and storage availability. Pulumi allows users to build images with Docker Build Cloud. The Pulumi Docker Build provider fully supports Docker Build Cloud, which unlocks new capabilities, as individual team members or a CI/CD pipeline can fully take advantage of improved build speeds, shared build cache, and native multi-platform builds. If you still need to create a builder, follow the steps below; otherwise, skip to step 1C. A. Log in to your Docker Build Cloud account. B. Create a new cloud builder named my-cool-builder.\\\\u00a0 Figure 1: Create the new cloud builder and call it my-cool-builder. C. In your local machine, sign in to your Docker account. $ docker login D. Add your existing cloud builder endpoint. $ docker buildx create --driver cloud ORG/BUILDER_NAME\\\\n# Replace ORG with the Docker Hub namespace of your Docker organization. \\\\n# This creates a builder named cloud-ORG-BUILDER_NAME.\\\\n\\\\n# Example:\\\\n$ docker buildx create --driver cloud pulumi/my-cool-builder\\\\n# cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder\\\\n\\\\n# check your new builder is configured\\\\n$ docker buildx ls\\\\n E. Optionally, see that your new builder is available in Docker Desktop. Figure 2: The Builders view in the Docker Desktop settings lists all available local and Docker Build Cloud builders available to the logged-in account. For additional guidance on setting up Docker Build Cloud, refer to the Docker docs. Step 2: Set up your Pulumi project To create your first Pulumi project, start with a Pulumi template. Pulumi has curated hundreds of templates that are directly integrated with the Pulumi CLI via pulumi new. In particular, the Pulumi team has created a Pulumi template for Docker Build Cloud to get you started. The Pulumi programming model centers around defining infrastructure using popular programming languages. This approach allows you to leverage existing programming tools and define cloud resources using familiar syntaxes such as loops and conditionals. To copy the Pulumi template locally: $ pulumi new https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/dockerbuildcloud-ts --dir hello-dbc\\\\n# project name: hello-dbc \\\\n# project description: (default)\\\\n# stack name: dev\\\\n# Note: Update the builder value to match yours\\\\n# builder: cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder \\\\n$ cd hello-dbc\\\\n\\\\n# update all npm packages (recommended)\\\\n$ npm update --save\\\\n Optionally, explore your Pulumi program. The hello-dbc folder has everything you need to build a Dockerfile into an image with Pulumi. Your Pulumi program starts with an entry point, typically a function written in your chosen programming language. This function defines the infrastructure resources and configurations for your project. For TypeScript, that file is index.ts, and the contents are shown below: import * as dockerBuild from \\\\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\\\";\\\\nimport * as pulumi from \\\\\"@pulumi/pulumi\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nconst config = new pulumi.Config();\\\\nconst builder = config.require(\\\\\"builder\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n\\\\n   // Configures the name of your existing buildx builder to use.\\\\n   // See the Pulumi.<stack>.yaml project file for the builder configuration.\\\\n   builder: {\\\\n       name: builder, // Example, \\\\\"cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder\\\\\",\\\\n   },\\\\n   context: {\\\\n       location: \\\\\"app\\\\\",\\\\n   },\\\\n   // Enable exec to run a custom docker-buildx binary with support\\\\n   // for Docker Build Cloud (DBC).\\\\n   exec: true,\\\\n   push: false,\\\\n});\\\\n Step 3: Build your Docker image Run the pulumi up command to see the image being built with the newly configured builder: $ pulumi up --yes\\\\n You can follow the browser link to the Pulumi Cloud dashboard and navigate to the Image resource to confirm it\\\\u2019s properly configured by noting the builder parameter. Figure 3: Navigate to the Image resource to check the configuration. Optionally, also check your Docker Build Cloud dashboard for build minutes usage: Figure 4: The build.docker.com view shows the user has selected the Cloud builders from the left menu and the product dashboard is shown on the right side. Congratulations! You have built an NGINX Dockerfile with Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi. This was achieved by creating a new Docker Build Cloud builder and passing that to a Pulumi template. The Pulumi CLI is then used to deploy the changes. Advanced use cases with buildx and BuildKit To showcase popular buildx and BuildKit features, test one or more of the following Pulumi code samples. These include multi-platform, advanced caching,\\\\u00a0 and exports. Note that each feature is available as an input (or parameter) in the Pulumi Docker Build Image resource.\\\\u00a0 Multi-platform image builds for Docker Build Cloud Docker images can support multiple platforms, meaning a single image may contain variants for architectures and operating systems.\\\\u00a0 The following code snippet is analogous to invoking a build from the Docker CLI with the --platform flag to specify the target platform for the build output. import * as dockerBuild from \\\\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n   // Build a multi-platform image manifest for ARM and AMD.\\\\n   platforms: [\\\\n       dockerBuild.Platform.Linux_amd64,\\\\n       dockerBuild.Platform.Linux_arm64,\\\\n   ],\\\\n   push: false,\\\\n\\\\n});\\\\n Deploy the changes made to the Pulumi program: $ pulumi up --yes\\\\n Caching from and to AWS ECR Maintaining cached layers while building Docker images saves precious time by enabling faster builds. However, utilizing cached layers has been historically challenging in CI/CD pipelines due to recycled environments between builds. The cacheFrom and cacheTo parameters allow programmatic builds to optimize caching behavior.\\\\u00a0 Update your Docker image resource to take advantage of caching: import * as dockerBuild from \\\\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\\\";\\\\nimport * as pulumi from \\\\\"@pulumi/pulumi\\\\\";\\\\nimport * as aws from \\\\\"@pulumi/aws\\\\\"; // Required for ECR\\\\n\\\\n// Create an ECR repository for pushing.\\\\nconst ecrRepository = new aws.ecr.Repository(\\\\\"ecr-repository\\\\\", {});\\\\n\\\\n// Grab auth credentials for ECR.\\\\nconst authToken = aws.ecr.getAuthorizationTokenOutput({\\\\n   registryId: ecrRepository.registryId,\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n   push: true,\\\\n   // Use the pushed image as a cache source.\\\\n   cacheFrom: [{\\\\n       registry: {\\\\n           ref: pulumi.interpolate`${ecrRepository.repositoryUrl}:cache`,\\\\n       },\\\\n   }],\\\\n   cacheTo: [{\\\\n       registry: {\\\\n           imageManifest: true,\\\\n           ociMediaTypes: true,\\\\n           ref: pulumi.interpolate`${ecrRepository.repositoryUrl}:cache`,\\\\n       },\\\\n   }],\\\\n   // Provide our ECR credentials.\\\\n   registries: [{\\\\n       address: ecrRepository.repositoryUrl,\\\\n       password: authToken.password,\\\\n       username: authToken.userName,\\\\n   }],\\\\n})\\\\n Notice the declaration of additional resources for AWS ECR.\\\\u00a0 Export builds as a tar file Exporting allows us to share or back up the resulting image from a build invocation.\\\\u00a0 To export the build as a local .tar file, modify your resource to include the exports Input: const image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n   push: false,\\\\n   exports: [{\\\\n       docker: {\\\\n           tar: true,\\\\n       },\\\\n   }],\\\\n})\\\\n Deploy the changes made to the Pulumi program: $ pulumi up --yes\\\\n Review the Pulumi Docker Build provider guide to explore other Docker Build features, such as build arguments, build contexts, remote contexts, and more. Next steps Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is key to managing modern cloud-native development, and Docker lets developers create and control images with Dockerfiles and Docker Compose files.

The URL Inspection tool reports what we expect since setting these pages to 404:\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll speak to @tobytteh\\'s comment here, which I think captures the frustration folks have and the underlying question of why we Pulumi feels comfortable generating code examples with AI:\\\\n\\\\nThis use of AI is monstrously stupid. Let us all pray to our respective gods that someone at Pulumi is intelligent enough to end this.\\\\n\\\\nCode generation is Pulumi\\'s bread and butter, it is a core competency of our engineering org. Every one of our providers has a rich schema describing the SDK (example Docker provider schema.json). Those schemas are then used to generate the SDKs for each language (source code in github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pkg/codegen). Pulumi AI combines this with retrieval augmented generation and type checking of generated programs to be more than ten times more likely to generate valid, working code for many questions than ChatGPT (GPT-4) on its own. Generating ten times better code than state of the art language models is itself a feat, but we aren\\'t resting on our laurels and we\\'re continuing to work on setting an even higher bar for ourselves to ensure that every program we publish would work from copy-and-paste to pulumi up.\\\\nThat said, we certainly didn\\'t expect the result of publishing as many pages as we did, and that\\'s why we\\'ve taken drastic steps to withdraw a significant number (around 2/3) of the AI Answers. We\\'ll continue to raise the bar on quality and prune pages that do not meet our standards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nAll reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\n            Copy link\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAuthor\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\npetetnt\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n      commented\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        May 7, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          edited\\\\n          \\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPersonally I don\\\\u2019t think the (alledged) 2/3rds is nearly good enough ratio to spam the internet full of absolutely wrong answers.

These build upon and extend our rich Pulumi Deployments foundation for deployment orchestration and workflow. This is an exciting, customer-driven release, with new features that help with Day 2 operations and management.These new features are:Drift Detection and Remediation - Continuously detect and remediate driftTime-to-Live Stacks - Clean up stale infrastructure automaticallyScheduled Deployments - Automate recurring workflows on a scheduleFree Deployments Minutes - Use all of the above for free, no matter your tier!We built these features based on customer feedback, and our 2,500+ customers are excited:\\\\u201cAt Oleria, we understand the importance of addressing issues with privacy, security, and data integrity. Earning and maintaining our trust isn\\\\u2019t just a responsibility but a fundamental aspect of our mission,\\\\u201d said Jim Alkove, CEO of Oleria. \\\\u201cPulumi also understands how these attributes affect cloud infrastructure. Our team is excited to use these new capabilities, giving us even more confidence as we enable our customers to securely manage access to decentralized SaaS applications, adaptively and intelligently.\\\\u201dThese advanced features are available today in the Enterprise and Business Critical editions of Pulumi Cloud. These features together enable an end-to-end experience for managing the lifecycle and consistency of your cloud infrastructure to ensure enterprises have the capabilities needed to operate at scale.Infrastructure Lifecycle Management Capabilities - Excelling at Day 2 and BeyondSo, why infrastructure lifecycle management?Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is table stakes for our customers. It helps to ensure Day 1, 2, and beyond cloud practices are robust, secure, and dependable. However, operational realities mean that sometimes teams need more flexibility than what strict IaC and Git-driven deployments offer.For example, maybe you need to break glass and interact with the AWS console directly to open up SSH to an EC2 instance in order to debug a gnarly issue. Or maybe you need to scale up your Auto Scaling group (ASG) temporarily while a live-site incident of unexpected traffic peaks plays out. Or maybe someone added tags to your resource without knowing it was under the management of Pulumi. This can lead to drift, where your IaC configuration no longer matches reality, and reality no longer matches your IaC. This is where Drift Detection and Remediation comes in to automatically report on and reconcile it.Alternatively, you may want to enable self-service infrastructure provisioning for your entire team, including developers and data scientists, who are not infrastructure experts. But what if they forget to wind things down when they\\\\u2019re done? You are left spending valuable money and resources managing infrastructure that\\\\u2019s no longer needed. Time-to-Live Stacks automatically reclaim such ephemeral infrastructure, enabling self-serve with confidence.Next up, we often want to deploy on a Git commit, which Pulumi Deployments already handles. However, what if we want more flexibility around how and when deployments occur? For instance, perhaps you\\\\u2019re a retailer who doesn\\\\u2019t want to deploy on Black Friday. Or maybe you prefer to deploy at set times throughout the week rather than on every Git commit. This is where Scheduled Deployments comes in, to give us flexible cron-based scheduling of deployments.Finally, we want everyone to be able to kick the tires with all of the above, no commitments needed. That\\\\u2019s why we\\\\u2019re also announcing today that all users \\\\u2013 individuals, teams, and enterprises alike \\\\u2013 get an allotment of free monthly deployment minutes to use all of this.Get started now for free at app.pulumi.com. We can\\\\u2019t wait to hear what you think!Happy cloud spelunking.featuresinfrastructure-lifecycle-managementSubscribe to the Pulumi Monthly NewsletterEnter your email*Last UTM MediumLast UTM CampaignLast UTM SourceShare this post\\\\nGet StartedInstallDocumentationRegistryPublic RoadmapSecurityEnterpriseAWSAzureGoogle CloudContainersServerlessKubernetesAbout UsRequest a DemoTalk to a humanSupportCareersResourcesSlack ArchiveCase StudiesAwards & RecognitionsBrand ResourcesYour Website PreferencesSign up for our newsletterEnter your email*Last UTM MediumLast UTM CampaignLast UTM SourceTrademark UsageAcceptable Use PolicyTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyProfessional Services Agreement\\\\u00a9 Pulumi 2024We use cookies (and other similar technologies) to collect data to improve your experience on our site.

(Unless The Stack is sorely mistaken, \\\\\"Cloud Manager\\\\\" is a lick of Oracle paint on an underlying open source Terraform engine; or was... )Oracle\\\\u2019s OpenTofu shiftIn a short blog, an EBS product director at Oracle said that its \\\\u201clatest Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Cloud Manager update, 24.1.1.1, is now available,\\\\u201d urging customers to update \\\\u201cat your earliest convenience.\\\\u201d\\\\u201cIn this release, we have switched from Terraform to OpenTofu due to forthcoming Terraform licensing changes,\\\\u201d wrote Terri Noyes.\\\\u201c You must therefore upgrade your Cloud Manager to 24.1.1.1 by June 30, 2024 at the latest,\\\\u201d she said, adding that the release updated further components to \\\\u201cmaintain security standards and improve supportability.\\\\u201dThe move comes after Hashicorp\\\\u2019s 2023 decision to adopt a more restrictive BSL 1.1. Licence for Terraform and other products, instead of the MPL 2.0 that it previously used. That move triggered a swift fork, OpenTofu, adopted by the Linux Foundation. (Version 1.7 landed in March 2024 and was widely considered to be the first enterprise-ready version.)Oracle\\\\u2019s move seems like a straightforward decision to ensure it is using the most permissive underlying IaC tool without having to worry about downstream licence complications, no more and no less. OpenTofu is essentially a pretty familiar drop-in replacement for Terraform; using it here is ultimately a minor implementation detail for those looking to move complex EBS environments to the cloud, but it does signal that serious enterprises feel the fork is already robust enough to use.\\\\u00a0In late April IBM agreed to buy Hashicorp for $6.7 billion.\\\\u00a0See also: \\\\\"Red Hash\\\\\"?

When I first heard the rumours yesterday, I was concerned about the future of possibly my favourite Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool. It has long been obvious that Hashicorp has been struggling to make money, making a $274 million loss in 2023. This undoubtedly led to the highly controversial switch to the BSL license in August 2023 and the community fork of OpenTofu. Hashicorp is hardly alone in its struggles, with Redis adopting a similar approach, resulting in the Valkey fork or Elasticsearch with its license changes.The challenge of open-source monetisationFundamentally, many of these companies have struggled to sufficiently monetise the open-source tools they have developed, and this is where I want to bust a myth some people seem to have:There is no such thing as \\\\u2018free\\\\u2019 softwareSure, there is plenty of software that is free at the point of use and can be modified under permissive licenses and the like, but fundamentally, developers are spending time writing code, and time typically requires some payment.Source: https://accidentalastro.com/2022/12/will-code-for-food/I appreciate there are several hobby projects that people may contribute to in their spare time, but large open-source projects are typically supported by big tech firms contributing engineers or money to enable developers to work part or full-time on them; for example, look at the companies who pay to be members of the Linux foundation. As another example, Google is still the largest single contributor to the Kubernetes project. Google can do this because it makes money running services that rely on it, and sells a managed offering in Google Kubernetes Engine.Source: https://www.cncf.io/reports/kubernetes-project-journey-report/Hashicorp struggles with this, people have long used their free tool to orchestrate public and private cloud environments but had little reason to pay for the Terraform Cloud product even if it had some advantages.The problem with IBM buying HashicorpSource: https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2024/04/967925a7-hashicorp-ibm.jpgSo Hashicorp was a financial disaster even though they had good products, I have personally worked with Terraform & Packer and seen plenty of Vault implementations. A lot of companies liked Hashicorp tooling because it was inherently cloud-agnostic; for multi-cloud organisations, having a common configuration language in Terraform or a secret management solution in Vault was preferable to learning each in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or the multitude of other providers.This leads me to my first concern, IBM has a conflict of interest. IBM has a cloud offering, admittedly with a 1.8% market share. Why would they want to keep developing tools that frankly benefit their competitors more than them?My second concern, perhaps my biggest, is that IBM has a graveyard of failed acquisitions of good software companies. In recent history, their acquisition of Red Hat resulted in changes to CentOS that destroyed the market share of this once-popular distribution, anecdotally often in favour of Ubuntu LTS. This is far from the only example with Lotus Software being another from the 2000s. I simply have no trust in IBM to look after Hashicorp as a company.So, where do we go from here?Source: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQG7bJnXPlbrsw/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1520066260072?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=LZ84Bom6KUx4nsjuPkvZ_Pzb_W9znd8nih_k_s-XjfISo, the big question, much like the recent post-VMware price rises, I think there is a fork in the road. Either we continue to stick with Terraform, as IBM no doubt attempts some renewed monetisation effort to make good on their investment, or we change our IaC tool. With the latter, what are our alternatives?Well, let\\\\u2019s start with the obvious: OpenTofu. This is perhaps the easiest short-term \\\\u2018fix\\\\u2019 for those not running cutting-edge Terraform, where they can use a compatible binary based on an earlier version.Pulumi is another potential option, though I would have financial sustainability concerns for their business model which is similar to Hashicorp\\\\u2019s old model.Crossplane is another option that generates quite a lot of noise with a Kubernetes-centric view of the world. I previously blogged a little about this approach in the context of Google\\\\u2019s Config Connector, showing some merit. Crossplane uses a similar \\\\u2018provider-centric\\\\u2019 approach like Terraform allowing easier extensibility to different platforms. Whilst the project is CNCF-backed (and going through adoption at the time of writing) the main contributor appears to be Upbound whose financial sustainability I am equally unsure of.Another option is to \\\\u2018go native,\\\\u2019 with each of the big three hyperscalers offering its dedicated options: Cloud Formation with AWS, Bicep with Azure, and Config Controller in Google Cloud. The main downside I see with this approach is fragmentation. Part of the appeal of Terraform was its consistency in configuration language, with providers abstracting the vendor-specific API calls.There are no doubt many other tools I have failed to mention, and please comment on any additional suggestions you have.What do I think?Source: https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/15173534/gettyimages-611975304.jpgI believe an \\\\u2018Open Terraform\\\\u2019 supported in development by those who profit from it is the answer. This is sort of what\\\\u2019s happened with OpenTofu, which has backers such as Gruntwork. I would love to see an expansion of this support base to include all the major hyperscalers, who, in practice, are the ones making the most money from Terraform. Many of these hyperscalers are already deeply involved in developing providers that interface Terraform with their platform. Expanding this toward the tool itself doesn\\\\u2019t seem like a big leap; if they decide to do this, though, is anyone\\\\u2019s guess, especially with the news so fresh, we will have to wait and see\\\\u2026Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.FreeDistraction-free reading.

Pulumi is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform that simplifies resource management across any cloud or SaaS provider, including Docker. Pulumi providers are integrations with useful tools and vendors. Pulumi\\\\u2019s new Docker Build provider is about making your builds even easier, faster, and more reliable.\\\\u00a0 In this post, we will dive into how Pulumi\\\\u2019s new Docker Build provider works with Docker Build Cloud to streamline building, deploying, and managing containerized applications. First, we\\\\u2019ll set up a project using Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi. Then, we\\\\u2019ll explore cool use cases that showcase how you can leverage this provider to simplify your build and deployment pipelines. \\\\u00a0  Pulumi Docker Build provider features Top features of the Pulumi Docker Build provider include the following:  Docker Build Cloud support: Offload your builds to the cloud and free up your local resources. Faster builds mean fewer headaches. Multi-platform support: Build Docker images that work on different hardware architectures without breaking a sweat. Advanced caching: Say goodbye to redundant builds. In addition to the shared caching available when you use Docker Build Cloud, this provider supports multiple cache backends, like Amazon S3, GitHub Actions, and even local disk, to keep your builds efficient. Flexible export options: Customize where your Docker images go after they\\\\u2019re built \\\\u2014 export to registries, filesystems, or wherever your workflow needs.  Getting started with Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi\\\\u00a0\\\\u00a0 Docker Build Cloud is Docker\\\\u2019s newest offering that provides a pair of AMD and Arm builders in the cloud and shared cache for your team, resulting in up to 39x faster image builds. Docker Personal, Pro, Team, and Business plans include a set number of Build Cloud minutes, or you can purchase a Build Cloud Team plan to add minutes. Learn more about Docker Build Cloud plans.\\\\u00a0 The example builds an NGINX Dockerfile using a Docker Build Cloud builder. We will create a Docker Build Cloud builder, create a Pulumi program in Typescript, and build our image. Prerequisites  Docker Pulumi CLI Pulumi Cloud account (Individual free tier works) A Pulumi-supported language Docker Build Cloud Team plan or a Docker Core Subscription with available Docker Build Cloud minutes  Step 1: Set up your Docker Build Cloud builder Building images locally means being subject to local compute and storage availability. Pulumi allows users to build images with Docker Build Cloud. The Pulumi Docker Build provider fully supports Docker Build Cloud, which unlocks new capabilities, as individual team members or a CI/CD pipeline can fully take advantage of improved build speeds, shared build cache, and native multi-platform builds. If you still need to create a builder, follow the steps below; otherwise, skip to step 1C. A. Log in to your Docker Build Cloud account. B. Create a new cloud builder named my-cool-builder.\\\\u00a0 Figure 1: Create the new cloud builder and call it my-cool-builder. C. In your local machine, sign in to your Docker account. $ docker login D. Add your existing cloud builder endpoint. $ docker buildx create --driver cloud ORG/BUILDER_NAME\\\\n# Replace ORG with the Docker Hub namespace of your Docker organization. \\\\n# This creates a builder named cloud-ORG-BUILDER_NAME.\\\\n\\\\n# Example:\\\\n$ docker buildx create --driver cloud pulumi/my-cool-builder\\\\n# cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder\\\\n\\\\n# check your new builder is configured\\\\n$ docker buildx ls\\\\n E. Optionally, see that your new builder is available in Docker Desktop. Figure 2: The Builders view in the Docker Desktop settings lists all available local and Docker Build Cloud builders available to the logged-in account. For additional guidance on setting up Docker Build Cloud, refer to the Docker docs. Step 2: Set up your Pulumi project To create your first Pulumi project, start with a Pulumi template. Pulumi has curated hundreds of templates that are directly integrated with the Pulumi CLI via pulumi new. In particular, the Pulumi team has created a Pulumi template for Docker Build Cloud to get you started. The Pulumi programming model centers around defining infrastructure using popular programming languages. This approach allows you to leverage existing programming tools and define cloud resources using familiar syntaxes such as loops and conditionals. To copy the Pulumi template locally: $ pulumi new https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/dockerbuildcloud-ts --dir hello-dbc\\\\n# project name: hello-dbc \\\\n# project description: (default)\\\\n# stack name: dev\\\\n# Note: Update the builder value to match yours\\\\n# builder: cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder \\\\n$ cd hello-dbc\\\\n\\\\n# update all npm packages (recommended)\\\\n$ npm update --save\\\\n Optionally, explore your Pulumi program. The hello-dbc folder has everything you need to build a Dockerfile into an image with Pulumi. Your Pulumi program starts with an entry point, typically a function written in your chosen programming language. This function defines the infrastructure resources and configurations for your project. For TypeScript, that file is index.ts, and the contents are shown below: import * as dockerBuild from \\\\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\\\";\\\\nimport * as pulumi from \\\\\"@pulumi/pulumi\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nconst config = new pulumi.Config();\\\\nconst builder = config.require(\\\\\"builder\\\\\");\\\\n\\\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n\\\\n   // Configures the name of your existing buildx builder to use.\\\\n   // See the Pulumi.<stack>.yaml project file for the builder configuration.\\\\n   builder: {\\\\n       name: builder, // Example, \\\\\"cloud-pulumi-my-cool-builder\\\\\",\\\\n   },\\\\n   context: {\\\\n       location: \\\\\"app\\\\\",\\\\n   },\\\\n   // Enable exec to run a custom docker-buildx binary with support\\\\n   // for Docker Build Cloud (DBC).\\\\n   exec: true,\\\\n   push: false,\\\\n});\\\\n Step 3: Build your Docker image Run the pulumi up command to see the image being built with the newly configured builder: $ pulumi up --yes\\\\n You can follow the browser link to the Pulumi Cloud dashboard and navigate to the Image resource to confirm it\\\\u2019s properly configured by noting the builder parameter. Figure 3: Navigate to the Image resource to check the configuration. Optionally, also check your Docker Build Cloud dashboard for build minutes usage: Figure 4: The build.docker.com view shows the user has selected the Cloud builders from the left menu and the product dashboard is shown on the right side. Congratulations! You have built an NGINX Dockerfile with Docker Build Cloud and Pulumi. This was achieved by creating a new Docker Build Cloud builder and passing that to a Pulumi template. The Pulumi CLI is then used to deploy the changes. Advanced use cases with buildx and BuildKit To showcase popular buildx and BuildKit features, test one or more of the following Pulumi code samples. These include multi-platform, advanced caching,\\\\u00a0 and exports. Note that each feature is available as an input (or parameter) in the Pulumi Docker Build Image resource.\\\\u00a0 Multi-platform image builds for Docker Build Cloud Docker images can support multiple platforms, meaning a single image may contain variants for architectures and operating systems.\\\\u00a0 The following code snippet is analogous to invoking a build from the Docker CLI with the --platform flag to specify the target platform for the build output. import * as dockerBuild from \\\\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n   // Build a multi-platform image manifest for ARM and AMD.\\\\n   platforms: [\\\\n       dockerBuild.Platform.Linux_amd64,\\\\n       dockerBuild.Platform.Linux_arm64,\\\\n   ],\\\\n   push: false,\\\\n\\\\n});\\\\n Deploy the changes made to the Pulumi program: $ pulumi up --yes\\\\n Caching from and to AWS ECR Maintaining cached layers while building Docker images saves precious time by enabling faster builds. However, utilizing cached layers has been historically challenging in CI/CD pipelines due to recycled environments between builds. The cacheFrom and cacheTo parameters allow programmatic builds to optimize caching behavior.\\\\u00a0 Update your Docker image resource to take advantage of caching: import * as dockerBuild from \\\\\"@pulumi/docker-build\\\\\";\\\\nimport * as pulumi from \\\\\"@pulumi/pulumi\\\\\";\\\\nimport * as aws from \\\\\"@pulumi/aws\\\\\"; // Required for ECR\\\\n\\\\n// Create an ECR repository for pushing.\\\\nconst ecrRepository = new aws.ecr.Repository(\\\\\"ecr-repository\\\\\", {});\\\\n\\\\n// Grab auth credentials for ECR.\\\\nconst authToken = aws.ecr.getAuthorizationTokenOutput({\\\\n   registryId: ecrRepository.registryId,\\\\n});\\\\n\\\\nconst image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n   push: true,\\\\n   // Use the pushed image as a cache source.\\\\n   cacheFrom: [{\\\\n       registry: {\\\\n           ref: pulumi.interpolate`${ecrRepository.repositoryUrl}:cache`,\\\\n       },\\\\n   }],\\\\n   cacheTo: [{\\\\n       registry: {\\\\n           imageManifest: true,\\\\n           ociMediaTypes: true,\\\\n           ref: pulumi.interpolate`${ecrRepository.repositoryUrl}:cache`,\\\\n       },\\\\n   }],\\\\n   // Provide our ECR credentials.\\\\n   registries: [{\\\\n       address: ecrRepository.repositoryUrl,\\\\n       password: authToken.password,\\\\n       username: authToken.userName,\\\\n   }],\\\\n})\\\\n Notice the declaration of additional resources for AWS ECR.\\\\u00a0 Export builds as a tar file Exporting allows us to share or back up the resulting image from a build invocation.\\\\u00a0 To export the build as a local .tar file, modify your resource to include the exports Input: const image = new dockerBuild.Image(\\\\\"image\\\\\", {\\\\n   push: false,\\\\n   exports: [{\\\\n       docker: {\\\\n           tar: true,\\\\n       },\\\\n   }],\\\\n})\\\\n Deploy the changes made to the Pulumi program: $ pulumi up --yes\\\\n Review the Pulumi Docker Build provider guide to explore other Docker Build features, such as build arguments, build contexts, remote contexts, and more. Next steps Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is key to managing modern cloud-native development, and Docker lets developers create and control images with Dockerfiles and Docker Compose files. But when the situation gets more complex, like deploying across different cloud platforms, Pulumi can offer additional flexibility and advanced infrastructure features. The Docker Build provider supports Docker Build Cloud, streamlining building, deploying, and managing containerized applications, which helps development teams work together more effectively and maintain agility. Pulumi\\\\u2019s latest Docker Build provider, powered by BuildKit, improves flexibility and efficiency in Docker builds. By applying IaC principles, developers manage infrastructure with code, even in intricate scenarios. This means you can focus on building and deploying your containerized workloads without the hassle of complex infrastructure challenges.

This happened with multiple searches and will probably get even worse as the time goes on.\\\\nExample\\\\nFor example search AWS Lightsail xray, brings up this AI Answer from Pulumi as the top result:\\\\n\\\\nLink to the AI Answer: https://www.pulumi.com/ai/answers/bLHAi4DutXJvbJyNngGRvS/optimizing-aws-lightsail-and-x-ray-deployment.\\\\nWhile this might seem like a good thing for someone, spamming high ranked results that are at best misleading and at worst destructive does not seem like something I would want to associate Pulumi as a brand. There\\'s already tons of generated, false content available on the internet and adding even more noise to the search results is not a good idea.\\\\nI would highly recommend Disallow:ing robots from scraping https://www.pulumi.com/ai/answers via Robots.txt or similar functionality.\\\\nAdditional context\\\\nAdding -inurl:[pulumi.com/ai] to your query will remove Pulumi AI answers from the search results, but it\\'s cumbersome.\\\\nContributing\\\\nVote on this issue by adding a \\\\ud83d\\\\udc4d reaction.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\\\\n            \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\ud83d\\\\udc4d\\\\n163\\\\n akx, joneteus, jhirvioja, anttispitkanen, happosade, ilmarivacklinsc, timiwahalahti, vvalkonen, mieky, HelloFillip, and 153 more reacted with thumbs up emoji\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nAll reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\udc4d\\\\n163 reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\npetetnt\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          added\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n  kind/bug\\\\n\\\\nSome behavior is incorrect or out of spec\\\\n\\\\n  needs-triage\\\\n\\\\nNeeds attention from the triage team\\\\n\\\\n  labels\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    Mar 21, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\n            Copy link\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAaronFriel\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n      commented\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        Mar 22, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          edited by cnunciato\\\\n          \\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHey @petetnt, we\\'ve taken this feedback from you and others and we\\'ve taken steps to remove more than half (almost two thirds) of AI Answers, and we plan to continue to ensure that these AI answers are complementary to our existing documentation.\\\\nWe are also taking steps to:\\\\n\\\\nEnsure our pages are grounded in the real APIs and upstream documentation\\\\nValidating the results, e.g.: via type checking and testing the generated code\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\ud83d\\\\udc4d\\\\n15\\\\n happosade, wolverian, mieky, joonakilpinen, shstkvch, XeroOl, dvaun, mikejk8s, lfuelling, drakmail, and 5 more reacted with thumbs up emoji\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nAll reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ud83d\\\\udc4d\\\\n15 reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAaronFriel\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        removed\\\\n  the \\\\n\\\\n  needs-triage\\\\n\\\\nNeeds attention from the triage team\\\\n label\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    Mar 22, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAaronFriel\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        assigned     AaronFriel and     interurban\\\\nMar 22, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\n            Copy link\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ncnunciato\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n      commented\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        Mar 22, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nwe\\'ve taken steps to remove more than half of AI Answers\\\\n\\\\nWorth mentioning this list was submitted to Google this morning, so it could be a bit before they\\'re removed from search results.

In short: we\\'ve gotten very positive feedback users when the pages show up appropriately and don\\'t clutter the first page of results in a search engine. We don\\'t want to throw out the good with the bad, and we\\'ve marked those pages as noindex. The URL Inspection tool reports what we expect since setting these pages to 404:\\\\n\\\\nI\\'ll speak to @tobytteh\\'s comment here, which I think captures the frustration folks have and the underlying question of why we Pulumi feels comfortable generating code examples with AI:\\\\n\\\\nThis use of AI is monstrously stupid. Let us all pray to our respective gods that someone at Pulumi is intelligent enough to end this.\\\\n\\\\nCode generation is Pulumi\\'s bread and butter, it is a core competency of our engineering org. Every one of our providers has a rich schema describing the SDK (example Docker provider schema.json). Those schemas are then used to generate the SDKs for each language (source code in github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pkg/codegen). Pulumi AI combines this with retrieval augmented generation and type checking of generated programs to be more than ten times more likely to generate valid, working code for many questions than ChatGPT (GPT-4) on its own. Generating ten times better code than state of the art language models is itself a feat, but we aren\\'t resting on our laurels and we\\'re continuing to work on setting an even higher bar for ourselves to ensure that every program we publish would work from copy-and-paste to pulumi up.\\\\nThat said, we certainly didn\\'t expect the result of publishing as many pages as we did, and that\\'s why we\\'ve taken drastic steps to withdraw a significant number (around 2/3) of the AI Answers. We\\'ll continue to raise the bar on quality and prune pages that do not meet our standards.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nAll reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\n            Copy link\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAuthor\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\npetetnt\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n      commented\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        May 7, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          edited\\\\n          \\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPersonally I don\\\\u2019t think the (alledged) 2/3rds is nearly good enough ratio to spam the internet full of absolutely wrong answers. Not to mention the page mentioned in the first post is still up and indexed for example, which makes me think that you are willing to risk it for a piece of the much obsessed AI pie.\\\\nFor example publishing an index of valid answers while keeping the actual index out the results would probably satisfy those looking for AI answers too.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\nAll reactions\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n    \\\\n            Copy link\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMember\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAaronFriel\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n      \\\\n\\\\n      commented\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n        May 7, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u2022\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n          edited\\\\n          \\\\n        \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn the interest of transparency, I\\'m happy to set up a call to chat and prove that 2/3 figure.

These build upon and extend our rich Pulumi Deployments foundation for deployment orchestration and workflow. This is an exciting, customer-driven release, with new features that help with Day 2 operations and management.These new features are:Drift Detection and Remediation - Continuously detect and remediate driftTime-to-Live Stacks - Clean up stale infrastructure automaticallyScheduled Deployments - Automate recurring workflows on a scheduleFree Deployments Minutes - Use all of the above for free, no matter your tier!We built these features based on customer feedback, and our 2,500+ customers are excited:\\\\u201cAt Oleria, we understand the importance of addressing issues with privacy, security, and data integrity. Earning and maintaining our trust isn\\\\u2019t just a responsibility but a fundamental aspect of our mission,\\\\u201d said Jim Alkove, CEO of Oleria. \\\\u201cPulumi also understands how these attributes affect cloud infrastructure. Our team is excited to use these new capabilities, giving us even more confidence as we enable our customers to securely manage access to decentralized SaaS applications, adaptively and intelligently.\\\\u201dThese advanced features are available today in the Enterprise and Business Critical editions of Pulumi Cloud. These features together enable an end-to-end experience for managing the lifecycle and consistency of your cloud infrastructure to ensure enterprises have the capabilities needed to operate at scale.Infrastructure Lifecycle Management Capabilities - Excelling at Day 2 and BeyondSo, why infrastructure lifecycle management?Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is table stakes for our customers. It helps to ensure Day 1, 2, and beyond cloud practices are robust, secure, and dependable. However, operational realities mean that sometimes teams need more flexibility than what strict IaC and Git-driven deployments offer.For example, maybe you need to break glass and interact with the AWS console directly to open up SSH to an EC2 instance in order to debug a gnarly issue. Or maybe you need to scale up your Auto Scaling group (ASG) temporarily while a live-site incident of unexpected traffic peaks plays out. Or maybe someone added tags to your resource without knowing it was under the management of Pulumi. This can lead to drift, where your IaC configuration no longer matches reality, and reality no longer matches your IaC. This is where Drift Detection and Remediation comes in to automatically report on and reconcile it.Alternatively, you may want to enable self-service infrastructure provisioning for your entire team, including developers and data scientists, who are not infrastructure experts. But what if they forget to wind things down when they\\\\u2019re done? You are left spending valuable money and resources managing infrastructure that\\\\u2019s no longer needed. Time-to-Live Stacks automatically reclaim such ephemeral infrastructure, enabling self-serve with confidence.Next up, we often want to deploy on a Git commit, which Pulumi Deployments already handles. However, what if we want more flexibility around how and when deployments occur? For instance, perhaps you\\\\u2019re a retailer who doesn\\\\u2019t want to deploy on Black Friday. Or maybe you prefer to deploy at set times throughout the week rather than on every Git commit. This is where Scheduled Deployments comes in, to give us flexible cron-based scheduling of deployments.Finally, we want everyone to be able to kick the tires with all of the above, no commitments needed. That\\\\u2019s why we\\\\u2019re also announcing today that all users \\\\u2013 individuals, teams, and enterprises alike \\\\u2013 get an allotment of free monthly deployment minutes to use all of this.Get started now for free at app.pulumi.com. We can\\\\u2019t wait to hear what you think!Happy cloud spelunking.featuresinfrastructure-lifecycle-managementSubscribe to the Pulumi Monthly NewsletterEnter your email*Last UTM MediumLast UTM CampaignLast UTM SourceShare this post\\\\nGet StartedInstallDocumentationRegistryPublic RoadmapSecurityEnterpriseAWSAzureGoogle CloudContainersServerlessKubernetesAbout UsRequest a DemoTalk to a humanSupportCareersResourcesSlack ArchiveCase StudiesAwards & RecognitionsBrand ResourcesYour Website PreferencesSign up for our newsletterEnter your email*Last UTM MediumLast UTM CampaignLast UTM SourceTrademark UsageAcceptable Use PolicyTerms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicyProfessional Services Agreement\\\\u00a9 Pulumi 2024We use cookies (and other similar technologies) to collect data to improve your experience on our site.

(Unless The Stack is sorely mistaken, \\\\\"Cloud Manager\\\\\" is a lick of Oracle paint on an underlying open source Terraform engine; or was... )Oracle\\\\u2019s OpenTofu shiftIn a short blog, an EBS product director at Oracle said that its \\\\u201clatest Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Cloud Manager update, 24.1.1.1, is now available,\\\\u201d urging customers to update \\\\u201cat your earliest convenience.\\\\u201d\\\\u201cIn this release, we have switched from Terraform to OpenTofu due to forthcoming Terraform licensing changes,\\\\u201d wrote Terri Noyes.\\\\u201c You must therefore upgrade your Cloud Manager to 24.1.1.1 by June 30, 2024 at the latest,\\\\u201d she said, adding that the release updated further components to \\\\u201cmaintain security standards and improve supportability.\\\\u201dThe move comes after Hashicorp\\\\u2019s 2023 decision to adopt a more restrictive BSL 1.1. Licence for Terraform and other products, instead of the MPL 2.0 that it previously used. That move triggered a swift fork, OpenTofu, adopted by the Linux Foundation. (Version 1.7 landed in March 2024 and was widely considered to be the first enterprise-ready version.)Oracle\\\\u2019s move seems like a straightforward decision to ensure it is using the most permissive underlying IaC tool without having to worry about downstream licence complications, no more and no less. OpenTofu is essentially a pretty familiar drop-in replacement for Terraform; using it here is ultimately a minor implementation detail for those looking to move complex EBS environments to the cloud, but it does signal that serious enterprises feel the fork is already robust enough to use.\\\\u00a0In late April IBM agreed to buy Hashicorp for $6.7 billion.\\\\u00a0See also: \\\\\"Red Hash\\\\\"?

When I first heard the rumours yesterday, I was concerned about the future of possibly my favourite Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool. It has long been obvious that Hashicorp has been struggling to make money, making a $274 million loss in 2023. This undoubtedly led to the highly controversial switch to the BSL license in August 2023 and the community fork of OpenTofu. Hashicorp is hardly alone in its struggles, with Redis adopting a similar approach, resulting in the Valkey fork or Elasticsearch with its license changes.The challenge of open-source monetisationFundamentally, many of these companies have struggled to sufficiently monetise the open-source tools they have developed, and this is where I want to bust a myth some people seem to have:There is no such thing as \\\\u2018free\\\\u2019 softwareSure, there is plenty of software that is free at the point of use and can be modified under permissive licenses and the like, but fundamentally, developers are spending time writing code, and time typically requires some payment.Source: https://accidentalastro.com/2022/12/will-code-for-food/I appreciate there are several hobby projects that people may contribute to in their spare time, but large open-source projects are typically supported by big tech firms contributing engineers or money to enable developers to work part or full-time on them; for example, look at the companies who pay to be members of the Linux foundation. As another example, Google is still the largest single contributor to the Kubernetes project. Google can do this because it makes money running services that rely on it, and sells a managed offering in Google Kubernetes Engine.Source: https://www.cncf.io/reports/kubernetes-project-journey-report/Hashicorp struggles with this, people have long used their free tool to orchestrate public and private cloud environments but had little reason to pay for the Terraform Cloud product even if it had some advantages.The problem with IBM buying HashicorpSource: https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2024/04/967925a7-hashicorp-ibm.jpgSo Hashicorp was a financial disaster even though they had good products, I have personally worked with Terraform & Packer and seen plenty of Vault implementations. A lot of companies liked Hashicorp tooling because it was inherently cloud-agnostic; for multi-cloud organisations, having a common configuration language in Terraform or a secret management solution in Vault was preferable to learning each in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or the multitude of other providers.This leads me to my first concern, IBM has a conflict of interest. IBM has a cloud offering, admittedly with a 1.8% market share. Why would they want to keep developing tools that frankly benefit their competitors more than them?My second concern, perhaps my biggest, is that IBM has a graveyard of failed acquisitions of good software companies. In recent history, their acquisition of Red Hat resulted in changes to CentOS that destroyed the market share of this once-popular distribution, anecdotally often in favour of Ubuntu LTS. This is far from the only example with Lotus Software being another from the 2000s. I simply have no trust in IBM to look after Hashicorp as a company.So, where do we go from here?Source: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQG7bJnXPlbrsw/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1520066260072?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=LZ84Bom6KUx4nsjuPkvZ_Pzb_W9znd8nih_k_s-XjfISo, the big question, much like the recent post-VMware price rises, I think there is a fork in the road. Either we continue to stick with Terraform, as IBM no doubt attempts some renewed monetisation effort to make good on their investment, or we change our IaC tool. With the latter, what are our alternatives?Well, let\\\\u2019s start with the obvious: OpenTofu. This is perhaps the easiest short-term \\\\u2018fix\\\\u2019 for those not running cutting-edge Terraform, where they can use a compatible binary based on an earlier version.Pulumi is another potential option, though I would have financial sustainability concerns for their business model which is similar to Hashicorp\\\\u2019s old model.Crossplane is another option that generates quite a lot of noise with a Kubernetes-centric view of the world. I previously blogged a little about this approach in the context of Google\\\\u2019s Config Connector, showing some merit. Crossplane uses a similar \\\\u2018provider-centric\\\\u2019 approach like Terraform allowing easier extensibility to different platforms. Whilst the project is CNCF-backed (and going through adoption at the time of writing) the main contributor appears to be Upbound whose financial sustainability I am equally unsure of.Another option is to \\\\u2018go native,\\\\u2019 with each of the big three hyperscalers offering its dedicated options: Cloud Formation with AWS, Bicep with Azure, and Config Controller in Google Cloud. The main downside I see with this approach is fragmentation. Part of the appeal of Terraform was its consistency in configuration language, with providers abstracting the vendor-specific API calls.There are no doubt many other tools I have failed to mention, and please comment on any additional suggestions you have.What do I think?Source: https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/15173534/gettyimages-611975304.jpgI believe an \\\\u2018Open Terraform\\\\u2019 supported in development by those who profit from it is the answer. This is sort of what\\\\u2019s happened with OpenTofu, which has backers such as Gruntwork. I would love to see an expansion of this support base to include all the major hyperscalers, who, in practice, are the ones making the most money from Terraform. Many of these hyperscalers are already deeply involved in developing providers that interface Terraform with their platform. Expanding this toward the tool itself doesn\\\\u2019t seem like a big leap; if they decide to do this, though, is anyone\\\\u2019s guess, especially with the news so fresh, we will have to wait and see\\\\u2026Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.FreeDistraction-free reading.
